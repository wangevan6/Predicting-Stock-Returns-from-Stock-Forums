0,wallstreetbets,PG&amp;E California Power Utility ($PCG),"Richmond, California just passed a resolution to promote restructuring PG&amp;E such as utilizing a publicly owned Utility instead. It’s a small act that may not go anywhere, but it reveals the growing resentment over PG&amp;E as it is spilling into the local government level.

https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/east-bay-city-supports-california-cutting-ties-with-pge/amp/

Simultaneously, residential property insurance companies have been pulling out of California over wildfire concerns (Farmers for example just left). This directly affects the California residents who can afford condos and homes, as insurance options dwindle or raise rates. Maybe landlords will use this as an excuse to raise rent as well. Overall adds to negative press to PG&amp;E as they are often blamed for California Wildfires.

Next the Supreme Court will be releasing their decision on “City of Grants Pass v. Johnson” this summer which potentially enables cities to begin regulating homeless encampments, something that has been a hot topic in California for years. Gavin Newsom has used the excuse of courts blocking him to delay dealing with these California encampment. Once the supreme court concludes, Newsom will be pushed into taking action. Once that is off his plate, other California priorities such as Climate Change and Wildfires will gain more attention and air time.

https://www.ocregister.com/2024/05/09/crucial-not-cruel-and-unusual-the-supreme-court-weighs-homelessness-regulations/amp/

With Newsom’s team recently losing a lawsuit to ABC10 over hiding secret meetings with PG&amp;E plus having a bunch of ties between his team and the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) nd this power…ful monopoly, it may be in his best interest to publicly come down harder on PG&amp;E under the guise of fighting wildfires and promoting green energy.

Lastly CPUC (filled with Newsom’s nominated staff) is voting this month on adding a fixed fee to PG&amp;E bills that will raise rates for many California residents, specifically those that aren’t considered low income and do not or cannot afford an EVs. If that passes this can unleash a huge amount of potentially negative press on PG&amp;E. The fees would kick in during 2025

Extra: The EVP of PG&amp;E just filed a form 4 with the SEC for selling 83,495 shares at $17.53 ($1.5 million) last week. The week before the CEO sold 50,000 shares as well. I’m not entirely sure if I’m interpreting this correctly so please do your research.

1,wallstreetbets,Uber position update and thoughts going forward,"**Position Update**

About a month ago I posted DD about how Uber was going to miss earnings. They reported yesterday before the open and as the prediction materialized, I had a lot of people ask me to post a position update and gains.

When I created that post, I had just initiated a position of a 100 share short, 18 July $70 puts and 15 May $65 puts. I have since traded around the position and posted regular updates on the original post in the comments as they changed up until a couple of weeks ago.

https://preview.redd.it/2ublza1defzc1.png?width=820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e23903f9ab8f9bb98781f9e5eb90ac984a7b5727

There's a lot here, but to summarize, I am now short 1100 shares and have closed all options except 10 lotto weekly $62 puts that I opened on Tuesday EOD that I expect to expire worthless. Net, on the options I made $8,185. On the short I'm up roughly $2,600 as of this morning with today's pump.

I covered 200 shares of my 900 share short on Wednesday and opened 10 $65 puts and then added another 10 yesterday in the early session when the stock pumped and then sold them all an hour or two later.

**Thoughts Going Forward**

So where do I stand now on Uber? I still think this is a trash business and easy short and I'm still significantly short with no plans to cover. Actually I promptly put out another 400 shares yesterday at the open. For those interested, here I'll explain why.

The CEO is full of crap. They have no play in self-driving, they divested themselves of their autonomous unit but still want the best of both worlds- to be considered a call on the future of self-driving by being “the network” while not actually investing any money in its development and slashing costs left and right to try and eek out a profit (which they still are barely able to do with peak travel).

What makes Uber's situation unique is that they have enormous stock holdings relative to cash and they are barely profitable so these momentary movements have a huge effect on their quarterly income. Kinda crazy for a $160 billion company’s fortunes to be tied to three stocks with a combined market cap of $42 billion. I listened to Dara's interview yesterday on Squawk Box and he talked about their significant investments. What they really own are three spac stocks that they use as a call option on the autonomous/delivery future theme so they can play the foward-thinking future of logistics card.

I travelled last quarter many times for work and I’ve never seen it so busy. Yet Uber still managed to miss gross bookings estimates. Their comps will never be more difficult than they are now and that is why I think this stock is heading much lower over the next several months. This is also the ultimate macro-sensitive stock as consumers will slash spending on ride sharing and delivery almost before anything else in a downturn.

**But capital gains and losses are priced in and the Street doesn't care about them!**

At least half the replies to my original post pointed out that the accounting for cap gains/losses was well known and certainly priced in yet I never heard a single talking head mention that as a consideration. I guess it’s so well known it goes without saying? /s

I even got the following chat from a concerned Redditor:

*""Hey saw your post on Uber. Not trying to hate but just a heads up that your thesis is wrong.*

*1) People won’t care about those losses / it’s not part of core results.*

*2) The value of the stock holdings represent a low single digit % of Uber’s market cap.*

*Happy to help if you have any other q’s on stock stuff / I do this professionally""*

**Let this be a lesson-** **the street doesn’t know shit** and people don’t read earnings reports beyond the headline numbers. If I, a complete accounting layman could figure this out in about a half hour of research scanning their 10-Q, it is pretty clear nobody reads them.

This is a stock that has been divorced from reality for months as it’s more than doubled on no fundamental news. I still think its one of the best short opportunities in the market and headed much lower as comps get more and more difficult coming out of this travel season and their own efforts to maximize profitability. They have no more levers to pull and are entirely dependent on the ebbs and flows of the consumer and regulators.

They masquerade as a logistics tech autonomous platform company when what they really are is a glorified taxi company with much higher costs. The CEO is a charlatan. He has no innovative ability but for some reason Wall Street thinks he's the second coming of Steve Jobs. On the contrary he's a bean counter who has slashed their R&amp;D budget to focus on achieving profitability which they still haven't been able to consistently achieve. They basically do two things- maintain apps and handle customer service inquiries. **This will never be a significantly profitable business. The economics of it just don’t work.**

**Edit:** Just came across this on Twitter: [https://twitter.com/CNBCClosingBell/status/1788287155652923805](https://twitter.com/CNBCClosingBell/status/1788287155652923805)

What an idiot. And this dude actually gets paid to spout this nonsense. So marked to market losses mean nothing? Then why didn't the bulls cite the 2x beat last quarter as a nothingburger?

And the comparison to Berkshire is fucking hilarious. Uber is invested in complete garbage unprofitable shitcos and only three of them. The real reason they hold them is to pretend as if they're investing in autonomous driving and delivery in China. They have $5.5 billion in those investments and only $5 billion in cash. So when those stocks drop it makes a big difference. Of course the CEO will waive it off as nothing to make the numbers look better. But they also didn't even hit their estimates of gross bookings. That is the real reason the stock got hammered. I'll be back to see this putz when the stock has a 4 handle on it. From his analysis it is obvious he has no idea what he's even investing in (and he claims it's his largest position!).",0.73,9,0,9,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'DD'}]"
2,wallstreetbets,INTC Outlook and Marketcap vs Assets,"Why is foundry for Intel so important, despite only being a minor part of the company?

Their vertical integration makes both the consumer and server segments highly dependent on foundry. Although the upcoming Arrow Lake processors will be partially based on TSMC nodes, freeing those segments from their dependence, while still keeping all the benefits if foundry becomes competitve again. So long term consumer and server can only benefit from foundry and worst case survive on their own.

While 7B losses in foundry and news about Q2 earnings were quite bad and caused this bearish situation. Intel is still on track with foundry for 2024 with 20A and 2025 with 18A and 14A. 18A and 14A will be their first nodes ever, that will be sold over Intel foundry to other companies. Of course foundry is a very hard to ramp up business, that only generates profits in the long term, so investors had too much short term confidence in Intel's foundry business around 2021, that now dies off, before it can even generate it's first revenue.

I am certain Intel CPU's on TSMC nodes will be competitive, especially since intel ordered 3nm, giving it an edge over Amd (1)

So that leaves two options:

1. Foundry is sucessfull in the next 3-5 years:

=&gt; Intel consumer and server profit from vertical integration and outcompete everything else on the market, while Intel can sell expensive nodes to other conpanies with a high profit margin

2. Foundry is not sucessfull:

=&gt; Intel still profits by producing cheap nodes, for non performance critical parts of SoCs in house while staying competitive in server and consumer using TSMC. For the same reasons some capacity could still be sold to other companies at normal market rates, not turning huge profits, but breaking even.

Intel's Marketcap right now at 30$ per stock is around 130B, while it's net assets are valued at 192.7B. (2)

I only see Intel making progress from here on. As an investor I feel even safer knowing they are severly undervalued right now, even ignoring future foundry growth potential.

I for my part bought the dip, but remember I am highly regarded.

3,wallstreetbets,DD - Put ProKidney on your radar,"I know y'all like shouty AI-generated DD full of bad analogies, but let's try something different.

ProKidney ($PROK) is a pharma company that is developing a new cell therapy treatment for chronic kidney disease called REACT. About 30M Americans have kidney disease, and about .8M live with kidney failure, so it's very common and there is a lot of money in treatment - just look at the 12b market cap of DVA, a dialysis company.

PROK has made it through Phase 2 and is preparing to start Phase 3 of clinical trials BUT their manufacturing is on pause right now due to an audit of its quality management. They have brought in some new executives and are working on expanding operations over the next few years and opening new facilities in NC with the support of Greensboro and Winston-Salem. They say they have enough capital to survive through the end of the 2025, but plan on start manufacturing again ""mid 2024"".

**Bear Case**

The bear case is pretty straightforward: they are not able to start manufacturing again OR they start manufacturing again but the Phase 3 results disappoint. This is certainly a possibility and a big risk. There is not a lot of news that comes out about the company and it's hard to tell if they are on schedule. There is a real danger they could burn through their cash and go BK.

**Bull Case**

The short-term bull case is that they start manufacturing again in the next few months. This positive news could be a catalyst that brings buyers. A longer-term bull case is that they not only fix their quality issues and start manufacturing again, but also have positive Stage 3 results. This could 5-10x in the next 2 years if things go right.

**Price**

About a month ago, the price shot up on no news. I think this got picked up by some short screener algos and some pharma tracking sites. However, I don't think this is any kind of squeeze play so I don't even want to speak to short interest. The play here is primarily that positive news comes out in the next few months.

Also, it's worth noting that the options for this ticker are not very liquid. There is at least an option chain so you can try to grab contracts, but don't bid-ask spreads are huge and you won't move anything quickly.

Earnings are tomorrow, so hopefully they provide some positive updates about their production.

**Disclosure**

I am long PROK. I am holding shares, $2.50 5/17 calls, and $2.50 6/21 calls. I plan on rolling those contracts forward until there is some news. I see this as a true bet with high risk and high upside.

4,wallstreetbets,Robinhood Q1 Earnings - Is It A Trap?,"**Summary:**

I believe Robinhood is poised to blow expectations out of the water for it's Q1 earnings after hours today. The question is whether Q2 guidance is just as promising.

* [Positive GAAP Net Income](https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_financials/2023/q4/Q4-2023-Earnings-Presentation.pdf) in two of the last three quarters - growth in profitability will show Robinhood has turned it around for good
* Strong product velocity with introduction of it's Gold credit card and growth of it's Retirement Products
* International expansion into the UK and EU will grow user base
* Promising [January and February 2024 metrics](https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_events/2024/Mar/13/robinhood-markets-inc-february-2024-monthly-metrics.pdf)

**Background:**  It doesn't take much to convince WSB to be bullish on $HOOD. Both equities and crypto have been reaching new all time highs in 2024. A telltale sign is the reemergence of meme stocks and alt coins - degenerate gamblers are once again watching their lifesavings bounce up and down on a stupid green app on their phone.

https://preview.redd.it/dvtszvfdd8zc1.png?width=2762&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cf88eeab30867c40464f42ab2f3ae47332e9db1

**Reaching Profitability:** In Q4 2023, Robinhood posted it's second profitable quarter ever with a net income of $30M. Additionally, both equities and crypto have been skyrocketing all of 2024, which drive more active users and more transactions on their platform. Favorable market conditions will likely show Robinhood is maturing out of their growth-at-all-costs stage.

More importantly however was a decline in Total Operating Expenses. In 2023, Robinhood had $2.4B in expenses, resulting in negative profitability accounting for the whole year. However for 2024, the company projects only $1.9B. This shows the company is finally maturing as a company and will continue to focus on delivering profitability over growth-at-all-costs. If revenues are up and the company has accurate projections on operating expenses, the company will have positive net income again.

**International Expansion:** Some important metrics to look out for are related to Robinhood's expansion of stock trading into the UK and crypto trading into the EU. This is the app's first expansion into the international market.  The number of users only grew 2% (400k funded accounts) year over year between 2022 and 2023, and has essentially become stagnant after Q2 2021. This app desperately needs new users for growth. To determine how much it will grow we can look at a failed attempt to expand in 2019 (due to regulations) - Robinhood announced a 300k waiting list for the UK. Lets be cautious and use this same number despite it likely being higher in 2024. 300k extra users would 1.28% growth in funded customers in the UK alone. We know from it's Q4 report that it generates $81 per user however nearly 60% of revenue comes from margin investing, which is not allowed in the UK due to regulations. Now for some math:

300,000 new users x ($81 rev/user x 0.4 excluding margin rev) = $9.7M additional revenue from the UK expansion. Q4 had $471M in revenue.

Note: This plans were announced last quarter but actually launched in March 2024. These number are more useful in predicting guidance for Q2 rather than earnings for Q1.

**Possible Speed Bumps:**  We've seen many times over the last few weeks where beating earnings expectations has an inverse affect on the stock price. META, TSLA, NFLX just to name a few. Although I am fully confident Robinhood will meet and exceed expectations, I'm concerned it could still tank after hours if it does not forecast another stellar Q2. 

Consider that the stock has already gone up 61%(!) over the last three months and is valued at $15B. It is trading at 64 forward P/E. For context Paypal is 12 and Square is 21. It must has very very strong Q2 forecast. 

It's possible Monthly Users and Trading Volume will shrink in Q2 due to the recent slump both equities and crypto. The question is can international users and new products like the credit card offset these losses?

5,wallstreetbets,Why ABNB earnings will be an absolute banger,"Hey guys, Airbnb is reporting earnings today and I wanted to know everyone's thoughts on it. So far they're looking to hit $1.8 billion in revenue, marking a solid 20% year-over-year growth. Guys, that's insane. That’s not just good; it's their best first quarter ever. We're looking at a net income of $117 million compared to a net loss of $19 million last year. The turnaround story here is all about scaling revenue while keeping a tight leash on expenses and raking in some decent interest income. This rocketed their net income margin from a shitty -1% to a pretty decent +6%.

So here I'm gonna outline my bullish thesis on Airbnb and try to justify buying calls for earnings. I want to know if it's a good idea. 

**Cash Flow and Share Buybacks**

Free Cash Flow (FCF) hitting a massive $1.6 billion, thanks to increased bookings and margin expansions. What does Airbnb do with all that cash? Buybacks. They’ve bought back $2 billion worth of shares and just announced a new buyback program up to $2.5 billion. This rewards shareholders and boosts EPS.

**Bookings and Travel Trends**

Travel isn't just rebounding; it's *evolving*. Airbnb’s total Nights and Experiences booked jumped by 19%. 36% spike in cross-border bookings. Long-term stays (28 nights or more) are also doing well, making up 18% of all bookings. This isn't just a rebound; how and why people travel is changing.

**Supply Growth**

On the supply side, Airbnb boosted its listings by 18% year-over-year. That's growth across the board... North America, Latin America, urban, non-urban, etc. More supply means more options for consumers and more revenue potential for Airbnb.

**The Analyst's Angle**

From what I've read all analysts are keen on Airbnb's performance, noting the resilience in travel demand and robust financial health. Looking at pre-earnings forecasts there are strong expectations based on prevailing travel trends and economic conditions.

### My thoughts

Airbnb is doing pretty damn well in our post-pandemic world. They're capitalizing on new travel behaviors, like increased interest in international destinations and longer stays, which could be a long-term trend rather than a short-lived reaction.

So guys, what’s the play here? Airbnb seems to be on a solid path with strategic stock buybacks, strong quarterly performances, and robust growth prospects in the travel sector. You can grab shares if you're looking for a growth stock with some stability and bullish market sentiment. I'm going to grab calls tho. IV on calls actually doesn't make it seem like it's worth doing. If you expect a 5% bump AH, calls won't be profitable due to the premiums right now. 5/10 160c is $5.80/share. But I'll go ahead and grab the 165c just to see, it's a little cheaper at $3.75/share.",0.79,140,0,140,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'DD'}]"
6,wallstreetbets,GOLD has woken up- KGC is a play to consider,"By now most people have noticed sleepy ol' Gold is moving up... and its moving up pretty fast... well at least for GOLD.

Now I read a post from a couple of weeks ago, where someone suggested gold at like 20k in 6 years... erm no. that just wont happen. GOLD while it is heavily traded and the theory is various central banks are buying it up currently causing the increase, its still fundamentally something used aa a commodity

But if you look at the long term chart, you can see how significant this breakout is. Its literally a decade in the making:

https://preview.redd.it/gxsutrvv78zc1.png?width=1718&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db17838abf1f85d5e6f880ee6fd513e2ea5bd591

What's telling is that GOLD hit $2000 in 2011 and then fell 50% to $1000, and then has taken another 9 years to test and re-test! $2000, before breaking out.. .



GREAT, so what? well my charting for dummies expertise tells me that a previous high of $2k, then a fall to $1k, before multiple tests and breakout, points to $3k. with an outside shot, it doubles the previous high and get to $4k!!



so how do you make money? well, you can buy GLD or some other tracker. or you can take a position in one of the miners.

Why do this?

Because simply put its a leverage play. Which bring me to Kinross Gold, KGC

For full year 2023,

they produced 2.1m ounces of GOLD.

their all in cost for each ounce was $1316/ounce

their **av sale price was $1945/ounce**

So $1.2bprofit, deprecation, other costs etc gave net earnings of $400m

  
2024 Q1 results inline with the above with an **average sale price of $2070,** Gross profit $570m. adjusted net earning $125m



SO...... if GOLD moves into a **new price range and averages $2500,** with other costs mainly remains the same. that would get them another $500/ounce on 2.1m ounces = $1.05bn

So their profit (depending on how they work their accounts) will go up 3.5 X!!!

(the guidance for 2024, 2025, and 2026 is 2.1m ounces. if youre thinking production isnt going up, well just maintaining millions of production in commodities is a big win!!)

  
So if EPS is around $0.40 at $2000/ ounce, it could be around $1.20 at $2500/ ounce

So on a pretty safe PE of 12, and EPS of 1.2 = **$14 a share vs  current share price $7.1**

NOW, in the year to come if prices go up to $3000 and they hedge which is very common with commodities, **EPS could be $2 and at PE of 12=**

 **share price of $24!!**

**so even forgetting just GOLD buyer hype, from a fundamentals point of view the share price has huge growth potential based on GOLD sustaining above $2000.**

Using charting for dummies, heavy resistance at $10, but then pretty clear up to $20

And this is why although I have calls in PAA as many do, as a midstream oiler, they dont directly benefit from the increase in oil price, its the volume of flow which benefits them. (OK sure more oil, likely at higher price.. but its not a direct influence). **With KGC they are directly impacted by the GOLD price.**

So what do you go for? you could just buy some KGC shares... but yeh options is the play.

GOLD does take its time. and so im not banking on any fast moves this year.. hence ive gone with the furthest out calls i can get:

Jan 26 $10 calls. currently around $.70 so if we manage to get to $20, thats an almost 15X return which isnt too bad given the fact that this a fundamentals plays and the calls are so far out.

CAVEAT, I do expect a drop in GOLD sometime soon.. so Im preparing to add to my position in KGC if GOLD falls back to around $2200

#WWE IS THE HOTTEST IT HAS BEEN SINCE THE 90'S

There was a time that WWE (WWF at the time) was at the forefront of pop culture thanks to Stone Cold, The Rock, and the NWO.  The industry ended up becoming seen as lowbrow entertainment less than a decade later, but thanks to the work of Paul Levesque (formerly HHH) pro wrestling has been restored to it's former glory.

Don't believe me?  Here are some numbers from Q1 this year:

- In the run up to WrestleMania in Q1 of this year, WWE sold out weekly televised arena shows for eight straight weeks https://www.pwmania.com/wwes-incredible-run-of-television-events-is-over

- Shattered attendance records for untelevised shows in multiple markets, including the highest attendance for an untelevised show since 2001 https://www.ringsidenews.com/2024/02/20/wwe-live-show-sees-record-attendance-not-seen-in-over-two-decades/

- Wrestlemania in April set both viewership and attendance records, with 145,298 live fans across the two night event and 660 million views across media platforms https://www.si.com/wrestling/2024/04/09/wrestlemania-40-ratings-record-rock-roman-reigns-wwe

- WrestleMania broke the WWE Youtube channel's record for views in a 24 hour window with 67 million views

- Broke their record for merchandise sales at Wrestlemania in a collaboration with Fanatics, seeing a 20% increase over merch sales at last years Mania

- Signed a $500 million /yr deal with Netflix on January 23rd

#UFC CONTINUES TO BE HOT

In addition to WWE's record setting quarter, the UFC has seen a great Q1 of their own

- UFC just had an incredibly successful UFC 300 with a $16.5 million gate

- UFC 300 was the UFC's 11th consecutive arena sellout

- UFC 300 prelims on ESPN peaked at 2.49 million viewers

- UFC 300 set the record for most merchandise sales ever at an arena show

- UFC 300 set the record for highest grossing sponsorship for a UFC event

9,wallstreetbets,CVS got crushed so PNTG may soar,"CVS awful quarterly earnings:
CVS reported earnings this week and they were horrendous.  The stock dropped 18% after release. The primary reason for the drop was a sharp increase in health care costs for their health insurance division.  Health care costs were $27.8 billion in Q1 2024 compared to $20.4 billion in Q1 2023.  This is a 36.3% increase. CVS covers 4.5 million Medicare Advantage members.  These members utilized medical care more than expected, according to CEO Karen Lynch.  

The Pennant Group:
The Pennant Group (PNTG) will release their earnings Monday after the bell. PNTG provides home health care services that are often paid for by Medicare Advantage plans. PNTG sends health care providers (registered nurses, nursing assistants, physical therapists) directly to the patient's home. 

Home health care is perfect for Medicare Advantage providers, like CVS.  This is because it provides an alternative to costly inpatient stays in hospitals and rehab facilities. 

The main point here is that there is likely to be a strong link between health care costs for Medicare Advantage providers (CVS) and revenue for home health care providers (PNTG).

Priced In(?):
Has this been priced in already?  It doesn't look like it to me.  PNTG is +1.3% (vs. SPY +1.5%) since CVS recently released earnings.  

But CVS isn't the first major insurance provider to tank recently on higher than expected medical costs.  Humana dropped 13% after their earnings were released in January. HUM is -32% in the past 6 months.  

While this increased utilization of health care by customers has been devastating for insurance providers, it has been an incredible tailwind for medical facility &amp; care stocks.  In the past 6 months, HCA is +33%, THC +119%, and PNTG itself is +83%.

My point here is that while past bad news from insurance companies has been priced into PNTG, the new unexpected high medical costs reported by CVS do not appear to have been priced in.  They indicate continued, persistently high medical care utilization by Medicare Advantage members especially.

Senior Living:
PNTG also provides senior living facilities.  Occupancy rates across this industry have been surging recently.  Welltower (WELL)  and Ventas (VTR) are 2 of the biggest providers of senior housing.  Both have recently increased their yearly guidance in their Q1 2024 earnings report in part due to increasing occupancy rates.  

PNTG earnings are Monday 5/6 after the bell.  I'd appreciate any feedback.

10,wallstreetbets,ELF: An Inflation-Fatigued Gal’s Best Friend,"Gather round, friends. We’re cooking up some serious tendies today.

And give this WSB lurker some grace on his first ever DD. I was waiting for somebody else who knows what they’re doing to do this DD justice, but I’ve been quietly profiting off the best of y’all’s work, and I’d like to return the favor. If I’ve done anything wrong, please let me know so I can update it, as I really do want to do this well. But if you can’t look past any formatting errors I may have, that’s on you. Feel free to hop over to yet another DJT write-up where a bag-holder from the initial spike will try to convince you it’s going to $100 by EOW.

So here’s the dealio… about a month ago, ULTA CEO David Kimbell told some folks at J.P. Morgan that ULTA had experienced a slowdown in demand during Q1. ULTA promptly dropped from $520 to $440 in a day and has kept sliding down to just shy of $400 as of this writing. Practically every stock in the beauty industry fell along with it. While lots of them are now drastically oversold given that all ULTA really did was predict they’d be on the lower end of their existing 4-5% growth guidance, I believe ULTA’s warning is actually amazing news for one Wall Street darling that took a pretty serious beating for no good reason and is now likely the cheapest it will ever be again.

Enter ELF. If you haven’t heard of ELF, I really don’t know what to tell you. They’ve been gobbling up market share like crazy by making “dupes” of crazy expensive beauty products and selling them for $12 instead of $70. AND THEY’RE REALLY FREAKING GOOD AT IT! As soon as some crazy overpriced product starts to take off, ELF cranks out their own version that most consumers actually like better than the original, and sells it for a fraction of the price… all while being 100% vegan, cruelty-free, and “guilt-free,” something the younger generations have been eating up. But enough lip service (pun intended). Here’s why a broke Master’s student like myself has bet almost his entire portfolio on this one stock:

1. 85% sales growth last quarter plus a huge guidance boost. While other beauty stocks have cut their full-year forecasts already in 2024, ELF has kept on raising theirs. For those who love consistency, last quarter was their 20th consecutive quarter of growth.

2. Piper Sandler’s Taking Stock With Teens survey revealed that ELF is the #1 top cosmetics brand among teens in 2024, with 38% of teens selecting ELF as their favorite brand, up from 22% in 2023. The next top brand is only preferred by 9% of teens. Talk about taking market share and building a loyal customer base.

3. My fiancée knows practically nothing about stocks, but I’ve been trying to include her in my investing strategy since my money will be hers in a little over a year. A few weeks ago, I started asking her which companies that she knows lots about were due for a big crash or a big upswing. She told me to short LULU. She didn’t understand why I couldn’t stop laughing until I pulled up the chart… it had tanked exactly six days earlier. I’m still kicking myself for not asking her the week before. Anywho, a few days later, she told me about ELF. I told her ULTA had just reported a slowdown in demand due to inflationary pressures. She asked if I was really going to listen to some CEO instead of her. I reminded her that we have a wedding to pay for. She told me if I listened to her, ELF would pay for our whole wedding and more. We went back and forth for a while, but here’s when she won me over—again, she knows almost nothing about stocks or markets or consumer spending habits, so this really had me speechless: “People aren’t responding to inflation by buying less beauty products; they’re responding to inflation by switching to cheaper ones. What if the so-called ‘slowdown’ is really just people switching from luxury beauty products to cheaper value products instead?” Quite a thesis, huh? And here’s the kicker. ULTA’s last quarterly report backs it up. ULTA’s total comparable sales increased 5.7% in 2023. That year, transactions increased 7.4%, but the average ticket decreased 1.5%. Translation ––&gt; ULTA is hurting because they’re selling MORE STUFF at LOWER PRICES ––&gt; If only there was an oversold company we could invest in that specializes in selling more stuff at lower prices ––&gt;  My fiancée is a genius and way out of my league ––&gt; Calls on ELF!

4. ELF fell with other beauty stocks after ULTA released a vague warning about slowing demand. In fact, ELF now sits a 28% below the all-time high it set in March. But if it’s true that the slowdown is mostly affecting companies like ULTA and their luxury brand suppliers (as indicated by their slashed guidance) and could actually be helping ELF (which raised guidance with their last quarterly report in February, presumably due to killer January sales), then ULTA’s warning could have both made ELF cheaper while also giving the SEC filing sleuths (that’s us) good reason to think ELF just quietly ended a knockout quarter which they will report earnings for on May 22.

5. My fiancée tells me the fastest growing segment of the beauty industry is skincare products. I haven’t fact checked her on this, but ever since she predicted a LULU crash that she had no way of knowing had already happened six days prior, I don’t question her anymore. ELF bought a skincare company called Naturium at a super fair price last October, and I expect that acquisition to only further boost their sales and outlook this next earnings release.

6. Let me save the bears some time in the comments. Yes, it’s PE is higher than other beauty stocks. But with 85% sales growth and 38% of all teenagers saying it’s their favorite brand (up 16% from last year), I think you’ll agree it’s warranted.

7. I know some troll in the comments is going to just copy and paste “buy high, sell low” in about as many ways as they know how, but ELF is actually well below its March high, and it just broke out of the head and shoulders pattern in time for a nice little run-up until (and up through) earnings.

TLDR: ULTA released a scary warning last month saying the beauty industry is in trouble, sending beauty stocks into a free fall. What they forgot to mention is that the beauty industry is only in trouble because ELF has been selling better products for lower prices than any other player could even dream of. ELF is oversold and will absolutely demolish earnings (and probably even raise guidance AGAIN) on May 22.

Positions: $165 call for 5/24 and a $145 leap call for January 2026. Don’t judge me for being poor and having only two calls… if you have the money, I strongly encourage you to load up on way more than I can afford to.

11,wallstreetbets,Pezempic aka Celsius DD Party ,"All right boys, here it is the DD to end all DDs.

If you pay attention, you might find yourself floating in a green field enjoying the results of your multibagger getting that divorce you've always wanted and in a position for the first time in your life to not have to ask your wife's boyfriend for an allowance.

The play this week is 100% Celsius. Ticker symbol celh.

Google it regards. 

Why do you want to put your entire portfolio into this on Monday? I'll tell you. 

Firstly, this stuff is literally liquid cocaine. I know every single one of you have done cocaine and you all loved it. 
Imagine cocaine in liquid form. This is it. Sales Bros. Everywhere are crushing these things so they can stay awake and hit 40% of their quota.  Managers are crushing these things so they can ask how many dials their teams are making and why they haven't hit their number 3 days into the month.

But here's the rub. It's not just the sales Bros that are getting forced back into the office due to regarded RTO policies anymore. I mean don't get me wrong. That's a big reason why you should be going full port on its own offices are stocking the s*** up like crazy and it's flying off the shelves. But now more importantly we're seeing the stuff pop up in gyms. And I'm talking all sorts of different gyms from planet fitnesses to your local CrossFit gyms. Why? Cuz it's basically a pre-workout too. You crack one of these bad boys before you hit the gym. You're guaranteed to have 100% gainz. Just like you're guaranteed to have 100% gainz on your profits this week. 

Secondly, their last earnings report was tremendous and there's no reason to believe that anything has changed. In fact, Pepsi just talked about them a bit in their earnings report and had nothing but positive things to say about the direction the company is going and their continued support. But it's not just the words. It's the actions. Pepsi is aggressively helping Celsius with their distribution Network, getting them into new markets as we speak and putting them up everywhere. Food stores, gyms offices you can't turn a corner without seeing this stuffb and that's partially due to Pepsi's commitment and full support with their distribution Network. 

I'm addition, they've actually come out with some pretty good new flavors. Their non-carbonated. Drinks are exceptional too.

Thirdly, they're going international. 
They announced it at their last earnings call and now they're executing putting in stuff all over the world so that more and more people can get addicted. 

Finally we shouldn't even be calling this stuff Celsius. We should be calling it PEPZEMPIC.

That's right folks. Not only is this stuff cocaine it's also healthy and helps you lose weight. It is a weight loss a drug that requires no prescription. 

That alone that last one right there alone means this thing is going to the Moon because all the fatties on the planet want to lose weight but they don't want to put in the effort to do it. Pop a couple Celsius. You're burning more calories than you do on a treadmill while shoving that cupcake and caramel macchiato down your gullet. Sure you might have a heart attack but who cares in the pursuit of good looks on only fans. There is no risk great enough for that.

Now here's the best part. We are not far off pre-last earnings Call pricing on stock. Sure, if you bought last week you'd be in better shape, but we're still not nearly where this thing spiked after a great earnings call in q1. Now's the Time and here's the play Monday. You pick your entry point. You buy the f*** out of this. 

Tuesday after this thing rips 15 to 20%. You sell before that guy from the FED who hates America comes out and says some hawkish stuff that tanks the market. 


Position 2 call strats EOW at $85 +
434 shares.

Good luck regards. I'll see you all in Valhalla.

13,wallstreetbets,SMTC  | Paul Pickle did NOT forget about the doubters. ( +400% 🥒 ) ,"Two months ago, I decided to write my first ever reddit post about my DD into a small underrated semiconductor company with a badass CEO named Mr. Pickle 🥒 to see what peoples opinions on the future of the stock would be, specifically for the upcoming Q4'23 earnings report.   
  
**Since my post SMTC has climbed almost 100%**

https://preview.redd.it/2t8w8lxqt3yc1.png?width=671&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=adb83733453c9f2abaac5738615e35ea77939b3d

With a supreme confidence in Semtech being undervalued, I was anticipating that it would beat ER expectations by a mile and leap to $30+ from its current price at the time ($22 per share) due to extreme underestimations, I was wrong about Q4'23 ER numbers I will admit, but absolutely NOBODY on earth can tell me I was incorrect about the company being undervalued.   
  
I was fucking STUNLOCKED when they actually had slightly lower then expected numbers and I will hold the L for that, but due to good guidance what I am also holding is a **+400%** flip on my original position in total :) When the stock rallied pre earnings I was able to cover my cost basis, while still holding 30C's which I then sold the week after ER.

 My plan is to take a portion of my gains and double down on long calls / leaps to sit on for a deeper timeframe, this recent push past the $35 level has my confidence at ATH for the long-term. Now trying to wait for a red day to hop back in which has been rare. ( currently **$38.68** per share )

On the horizon for Semtech I truly believe in the possibility of an acquisition, and the capabilities of IoT/LoRa technology &amp; data center enterprise computing to help fuel the AI / Tech abundant future. Hedge funds are starting to notice it and I hope anyone who read my post and believed in it being undervalued made a massive bag, and I pray that by writing this one I can help deliver more pickle's to come.

14,wallstreetbets,What rescheduling Marijuana means,"I think a lot of people fundamentally don't understand how monumental the rescheduling of marijuana is. I'm going to lay it out here for you:

Marijuana is going to be rescheduled from a controlled substance 1 to a 3. You may have heard that this puts in the same schedule as things like Tylenol, but so what, right? Why should I care, short that news! No, and I'll tell you why.

1. Rule 280E. This is the bane of the marijuana industry and is the number one reason why businesses have struggled. It states that any business that touches a schedule 1 drug cannot participate in federal programs or benefit from federal tax breaks. This is why the industry pays 40% + in federal taxes, and a total tax rate being in the 60% range in some states. This law will no longer apply to marijuana! That means a double digit tax break industry wide! That means growth and profits like the industry has never seen.
2. Marijuana businesses will have broader access to regular banking. That means lower rates to borrow. Refinancing debt to lower rates. No more risky cash only businesses. That means growth and profits on a massive scale.
3. Marijuana will now be able to be shipped across state lines in the mail.

All of this together will create a boom for the marijuana industry and stocks. It is hard to overstate the impact of the DEA's decision. When this becomes law, cannabis stocks are going to fly. The valuations of every marijuana stock will go up, and there will be a new floor. There are a lot of FUDsters out there trying to scare retail away from these stocks. You saw them short the heck out of them today. They know what is coming and are trying to bring the stocks down so they can get in themselves.

15,wallstreetbets,Snowflake isn't worth $50 Billion Dollars,"THESIS:
The issue with snowflake is that they’re a distributed data warehouse, not a distributed compute framework. 

However, distributed compute frameworks are more useful for complex “data science” tasks because most data needs to be ‘engineered’ before interesting analysis/machine learning can occur.

This post explores the idea that Snowflake is intentionally misleading investors by obfuscating the concrete services that they offer:

- Snowflake DOES NOT offer a general purpose ‘distributed computing framework’ or ‘distributed compute runtime’.
- Snowflake SHOULD NOT be compared to ‘spark’ in benchmarks
- Snowflake DOES NOT (physically) store your data 
   - subtext: storing data in cloud object store is trivial





THE EVIDENCE/ANALYSIS I PROVIDE IS BASED OFF OF:

- ~~- Carnegie Professor Andy Pavlo’s Snowflake lectures from his Advanced DB series~~


- My opinions about misrepresented features that have limited real world utility
- Misleading promotional information for investors
- My (limited) experience using the product
- Lack of substantive online discourse(Reddit, Youtube)

DISCLOSURE: 

- I’ve held a long short position(&lt;$8k) since ~December which I rolled over into a different long short position after the CEO resigned. Imo, the CEO resigning in February is worse in the long run for my position because it was a good business move. 
- FWIW, I don’t hold individual stocks; my entire portfolio is just VTI and this small amount of Snowflake puts. 
- I am a Software Engineer and I used Snowflake for a short period at work.

MY CLAIMS: 

- Snowflake's differentiated utility is confusing to the lay investor, industry, and their own customers
- Snowflake’s valuation should be closer to Vercel’s, in $5 - $10 billion range.

16,wallstreetbets,My Stellantis Calls Will Print ,"Stellantis has just had their Q1 earnings call. Basically the numbers were a lot worse than I expected, I lost another even more substantial portion of my life savings in a few hours on my calls so I stayed up late looking for Copium. I would like to be brutally honest and serious here. Trigger warning for the next part because first I need to get real.  

The bad news is that net revenue was down 12% probably on lower margins as vehicle sales remain constant as it seems they are struggling to clear glut of inventory however declining market share in North America and Europe seems to have stabilized. Part of my Thesis was the fact that while EV sales have slumped a little their ICE business was an underestimated solid cash printing machine with high margins for the next few years however it seems they have been affected by malicious negative consumer sentiment. I read online that Stellantis vehicles are the worst shit, overpriced, outdated and very unreliable (FIAT is apparanty now an acronym that means ‘fix it again Tony’) and insiders say they are failing to invest in expensive next gen motor technology, staff morale is appalling and quality control issues so maybe that is catching up with them however most of this was on reddit and reddit has an American bias although North America is still where they earn about 50% of their profit and is declining. Apart from that the few sales they had in China have all but collapsed down 50%, South America where they had strong growth reversed and the luxury division (Maeserati) performance also collapsed.  They also performed a lot worse than closest european competitor Volkswagen  did in Q1 which is trading on similar multiples

When I am down and unsure of myself I start to write a story so bullish that I start to believe in myself again. Despite the problems I still believe my $25 Jan 2026 calls are  going to print because BEV sales are up 8% and as the press release says they have 25 new models including 18 new BEV models  planned for this year of which they have only released 4 so far. This is only the start of the ramp up towards their [Dare Forward 2030 Strategic Plan](https://www.stellantis.com/en/company/dare-forward-2030) in which they plan to reach 100% BEV Sales in Europe and 50% BEV sales in Europe by 2030. They are the only ‘Legacy’ auto manufacturer to earn positive margins on EVs so far and will use their dying legacy auto business to finance this huge ramp up and become a profitable EV company. They say 800 km of range, yes 800 for their new models and ultra fast charging. Furthermore they have great eurpoor subdies in France and pressuring Italy to do the same or they will move production to France. If someone doesn't believe Stellantis will become a profitable EV manufacturer in the next decade they should not be an investor in the company.  ",0.58,3,0,3,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'DD'}]"

21,wallstreetbets,"AMD's Q1 Call... the good, bad &amp; ugly","Regarded WSB Community,

This is a post regarding AMD's call.

Revenue in Q1 slightly beat expectations... so did EPS. Margins are getting better. All good execution.   

The guidance is decent, considering there are some **BAD** moving parts which I'll cover below.   

I'll share the Good, Bad &amp; Ugly starting backwards...   

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **UGLY**: **GAMING** 

Gaming got killed in Q1 and will continue hurting. Why?   

* PS5 pro preparing to launch this year (so consumers hold purchases).   
* Gaming GPUs sell less due to new gaming architectures launching this year, with RDNA4 being teased in Computex in 5 weeks.     
 

**This explains why gaming dropped by 48% (and will continue dropping in Q2).**

**However, this is NOT a reason to be concerned, because:** 

* The Sony PS5 PRO will sell strong at launch... and will likely be hard to buy (as usual).   
* RDNA4 will sell STRONG, as AMD will only target the mid-range (no high-end this gen).   
* Gaming has low margins.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **BAD**: Supply constraints impacting MI300   

During minute 38 of the call (probably the most important item  discussed), while answering Vivek Arya's question (Bank of America), Dr.  Lisa Su explained that MI300 has more demand than supply also for Q2.  In essence, AMD can't sell enough due to supply constrains. AMD expects  supply to improve in the back half of the year, which is why they **raised the guidance** for over $4bn sales (up from $3.5bn).   

**However, this is NOT a reason to be concerned, because:** 

* Demand exceeding supply means that the MI300 series is COMPETITIVE.   
* As supply improves, so will sales... explaining why MI300 is doing **STRONG**.   
* Supply will catch-up with demand in 2024, making it possible to exceed the ""over $4bn"" figure.   

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **GOOD: Data center GPUs, CPUs and MARGINS** 

The most profitable and KEY products are selling **STRONG**.   

MI300 is a success... and the ONLY reason why AMD didn't sell more  was due to supply constraints. Also, Turin is sampling and the Data  Center segment remains STRONG.   

Growth of 80% year over year is impressive... with **STRONG** double digit growth for 2024 guided.   

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion:** 

AMD is supply constrained on MI300 products... but they were still  able to compensate the gaming segment (dropping 48%) and also embedded  (dropping 46%).   

It is likely that  $227 is a ceiling that will take many months to break.   

Also, today was a **BAD** day for markets, marking the close of the worst month of 2024.   

However, guidance for MI300 sales is 2024 is up... to ""over $4bn"" (from $3.5bn).   

I would've wanted to hear $5bn, but I'll likely have to wait until the Q2 ER, as supply improves.   

The stock will likely bleed tomorrow, but the core of AMD's thesis is still **STRONG**.",0.87,122,0,122,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'DD'}]"
22,wallstreetbets,Why I'm getting AMZN calls for today's earnings,"Amazon (AMZN) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q1 2024 results **today.** I expect amazon to do well today on both earnings and revenues, and I'll explain why here. The company outperformed the street expectations in the last quarter, with net revenues increasing by 14% to $170 billion. It was driven by a 13% rise in the North America and Amazon web services segments, followed by a 17% gain in the International division. We expect the first quarter result to follow the same trend. I also am anticipating Amazon will release a dividend like META and GOOG, which I'll go into a lot of detail later. 

Let's talk about AMZN's ride over the past few years—it's been a bit of a roller coaster, especially when you stack it up against the S&amp;P 500. Back in early 2021, AMZN was hovering around $165. Fast forward to now, and it's ticked up to about $180. Sounds decent, right? But hold up, because that's nothing compared to the S&amp;P, which has shot up by roughly 35% in the same period.

Looking at the yearly breakdown: AMZN only inched up by 2% in 2021, then took a massive 50% dive in 2022, but bounced back hard with an 81% surge in 2023. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 had its own drama but less extreme, posting a 27% gain in 2021, dropping 19% in 2022, and climbing back up by 24% in 2023.

The takeaway? While AMZN did outperform the S&amp;P in 2023, it lagged behind in the previous years. And this isn't just an AMZN thing—other big names in the Consumer Discretionary sector like TSLA, TM, and HD, and even tech giants like GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL have also found it tough to consistently beat the S&amp;P, in both up and down markets. So, what's next for AMZN? Let's keep our eyes peeled for their upcoming earnings report.

# Revenue Beat

Amazon’s revenues grew 12% y-o-y to $574.8 billion in FY2023. All major categories posted growth in the year – online stores (5%), physical stores (6%), third-party seller services (19%), subscription services (14%), advertising services (24%), and AWS (13%). We expect the same trend to continue in Q1. Overall, we forecast Amazon’s revenues to touch $641.4 billion for the full-year 2024.

# EPS Beat 

Amazon Q1 2024 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.85 per Trefis analysis, 2% above the consensus estimate of $0.83. The adjusted net income increased from -$2.7 billion to $30.4 billion in FY 2023. It was primarily because of lower operating expenses as a % of revenues, higher revenues, and a significant jump in the total non-operating income from -$18.2 billion to $705 million. Notably, the non-operating income was down in 2022 due to a marketable equity securities valuation loss. Further, the same trend was witnessed in Q4 2023. We expect the Q1 results to be on similar lines. Overall, Amazon is likely to report an annual GAAP EPS of $4.12 and revenue per share of $61.48 for the full-year 2024.

# Possible Dividend Announcement

Meta threw out its first dividend this March, and Google's parent company Alphabet isn't far behind, announcing a 20 cent dividend set for mid-June. This leaves us wondering about Amazon—when are they joining the dividend party?

By the numbers, it seems like it’s about time Amazon starts giving back some quarterly cash to its shareholders. Over the last decade, Amazon has racked up a cool $90 billion in free cash flow. Out of that giant pot, it only used about $6 billion for share buybacks in 2022, which is roughly a 7% capital return.

In comparison, other trillion-dollar behemoths have been way more generous, returning about 75% of their free cash flow over the past year—though most of that was through share repurchases rather than dividends. Together, these non-Amazon trillion-dollar companies generated around $323 billion in cash flow over the last year, paid out $38 billion in dividends, and snapped up about $240 billion in their own stock.

For Amazon, cash flow isn't the issue. Wall Street's looking at a projected free cash flow of about $62 billion for 2024, which is expected to jump to $82 billion by 2025, per Bloomberg. So, the big question remains: when will Amazon start sending some of that cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends? Let's stay tuned and see if they'll open up their wallet.

But what would this look like? If Amazon decided to payout 75% of its projected 2024 free cash flow, we're talking about a dividend yield of around 2.4%. That actually beats the average 2.2% yield from other dividend-paying companies in the S&amp;P.

This 2.4% isn't just dividends—it includes any buybacks Amazon might throw into the mix. To give you a benchmark, the total shareholder yield for S&amp;P 500 dividend payers has been about 3.3% over the past year. With Amazon’s hefty cash flow, it’s looking more and more like they’re due to start sharing the wealth.

Just for context, consider a bit of history. Microsoft went public back in 1986, and it took them 17 years and a revenue climb from less than $200 million to $32 billion before they started paying dividends in 2003. Since then, Microsoft’s sales have been growing at a steady 10% yearly, with around $28 in dividends per share dished out to date. Fast forward to 2024, Microsoft’s expected to hit sales around $260 billion.

Amazon, on the other hand, went public in 1997 and has exploded from $600 million to nearly $600 billion in annual sales. With projections showing a growth rate of about 12% over the next few years, Amazon is well-positioned to both fuel further growth and start paying dividends.

Currently, Microsoft’s stock yields about 0.8%. If Amazon wanted to match this, they’d need to allocate roughly 20% of their forecasted free cash flow for the next two years to dividends—totally doable since S&amp;P 500 dividend payers typically spend about half their free cash flow on dividends.

Bottom line: Amazon doesn’t need to aim for a 0.8% yield right off the bat. Kicking things off with literally any dividend would be a solid move. And if they do so, the stock will PUMP. This is why I'm getting calls for earnings. A call spread would be good, for those who can't get a call spread, AMZN 5/3 190c @ 3.20 doesn't look too bad. I'm picking 190c because the stock has *on average* moved about 7% up or down with earnings. A 7% push up today would bring the stock to about 192ish. Not enough for the calls to profit, so getting a call spread is deal. To do this, I'll just sell the 200c @ 1.19. So the cost of the whole position becomes 2.01/share. Not too bad. Good luck guys.",0.82,264,0,264,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'DD'}]"
23,wallstreetbets,Mercedes level 3 vs tesla level 2 here’s why Tesla will be a big winner,"I’ve seen in wsb the misinformation on how Tesla fsd is a joke, it will take another 20 yrs, Elon is a liar &amp; keep telling Mercedes is level 3 autonomy, superior to Tesla

Let me make it clear to you regards on how Mercedes level 3( drive pilot) is a joke &amp; why Tesla will be big winner in this category. Let’s go over each category here

Mercedes level 3 autonomy is what they call drive pilot &amp; we all know Tesla level 2 autonomy is fsd.

Here’s the big differences between Tesla fsd &amp; Mercedes drive pilot 

1)Mercedes drive pilot can only operate in highways whereas Tesla fsd will work on both highways &amp; city streets

2) The speed limit on Mercedes drive pilot is 40mph max whereas Tesla fsd is 85mph, here Mercedes drive pilot needs to follow other vehicles whereas in Tesla case it is not required to follow other vehicles.

3) Regarding the traffic patterns Mercedes is not capable of handling interchange whereas Tesla fsd is capable of most of the traffic patterns

4) Mercedes drive pilot doesn’t work with flashing lights in the area, meanwhile Tesla fsd functions with flashing lights 

5) Mercedes drive pilot doesn’t work in construction zones, Tesla fsd operates in the construction zones

6) Mercedes drive pilot usage in day time only whereas Tesla fsd can work in daytime or nighttime use

7) Mercedes drive pilot cannot change lanes whereas Tesla fsd can change lanes 

8) Mercedes drive pilot needs the lane lines whereas for Tesla fsd lane lines is not required 

9) Mercedes drive pilot is functioning only in California &amp; Nevada whereas Tesla fsd in all 50 states, Tesla in the last 24hr Tesla has launched subscriptions for Enhanced Autopilot (EAP) in China, as many expect that the company could soon launch its Full Self-Driving (FSD) in the country

So if you look above the staggering difference between Tesla fsd &amp; Mercedes drive pilot, Tesla is making a steady progress &amp; will be big winner in this category. 

Now before you tesla haters, 🐻 open your mouth on how Tesla fsd is still level 2 autonomy &amp; is inferior to Mercedes drive pilot, remember to do some research. Tesla hate on wsb is getting real &amp; constant fudge on how Tesla will fail is laughable 

They won’t go bankrupt, yes they had a shitty quarter but holding 27 billion cash. If tesla can’t make it no other evs. Atleast Tesla is making money on every car they sell whereas wsb darling rivian is losing 40k for every car they sell.

If Jpow keeps interest rates high rivian is fucked big time

24,wallstreetbets,Investing Pivot,"I've been an active investor in ETFs and individual stocks since graduating college in 2010. I've tried a little bit of everything and learned a lot (from good investments and some really bad ones) along the way. I've done broad market ETFs, sector ETFs, leveraged ETFs, commodity ETNs, penny stocks, risky biotech stocks that \*might\* go to the moon but will probably get pink slipped, solid large cap stocks, memestocks, option spreads, option calls and puts. etc... It's been a wild ride and I've learned a lot. While I made a lot of bad investments, I am grateful that I didn't do anything too reckless and only gambled a little bit of my money on insane ideas.

Overall my portfolio has done well in the past 14 years so I feel like I made money while going to school. I made a few really good large investments in large cap ETFs and a few companies that have done extremely well (NVDA, ANET, META, CYBR, BRK/B) But now it's time to simplify.

Now I am applying all those lessons learned to update my portfolio holdings to just the ETFs and companies I believe in for the long term. At the end of last year I had a lot of random little investments in all kinds of companies and ETFs and it was just ridiculous. Over 60 individual company stocks and dozens of different ETFs. I took diversification to an extreme that just wasn't making a difference and holding me back due to opportunity cost.

What I'm looking to do now is to sell off all the random ETFs and stocks that aren't my top picks. The famous saying from Warren Buffet about diversification I believe holds true about ETFs as well as individual companies. ""*If you can identify six wonderful businesses, that is all the diversification you need. And you will make a lot of money. And I can guarantee that going into a seventh one instead of putting more money into your first one is gotta be terrible mistake. Very few people have gotten rich on their seventh best idea. But a lot of people have gotten rich with their best idea.""*

Now I'm not nearly as good at evaluating companies as Warren Buffett. So my approach will be to identify my shortlist of favorite ETFs for long term growth as well as a few high conviction companies. I will consolidate my holdings into just these etfs / stocks.

I've done a lot of research this is where I've landed. I will rebalance as needed to make sure i don't get overly concentrated.

Large Cap US S&amp;P 500: VOO / SPLG

Dividend Growth: VIG

Large Cap Growth: SCHG

Mid Cap Growth: IMCG

Mid Cap Value: COWZ

Small Cap Value: CALF

Semiconductors: SMH

I'm also experimenting a little with GPIQ and SPHY for yield, but I'm more focused on growth than yield at this point.

As for individual stocks, my key holdings are:

NVDA

META

GOOG

BRK.B

TSLA

CYBR

ANET

AVGO

MSFT

AMZN

PLTR

I realize this is very large cap growth / tech stock heavy... especially with some of my stock holdings also representing a significant weighting in the ETFs. But I am ok with this.I'm done with ETFs for REITS, Emerging Markets, International. In both good and bad economic environments since 2010 they don't typically provide outperformance and I would have been way better off just putting the money into a US S&amp;P500 fund. I don't see any compelling reason to keep any money in these kind of funds anymore.I was looking for potential exposure to more small caps (esp growth) but I haven't found an ETF that is all that compelling in this space.

Curious what feedback people have. Is there something big I'm missing by avoiding International and REITs? Am I too concentrated in large cap tech? Am I leaning way too much on good past performance of large caps? Are there any fantastic ETFs I should considering adding to my short list?

For years I tried to buy beat up sectors and stocks hoping they would outperform, but I've seen just the opposite. So my strategy now is to stay relatively diversified into ETFs / companies that have a history of consistent strong performance and strong business models.",0.78,41,0,41,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'DD'}]"
25,wallstreetbets,Apple - Regardless of this Quarter; Now is the time,"Based on recent market activity I think this is a good entry point for Apple off the lows.

Here are all the reasons why not to like Apple right now

* Fall in phone sales especially in China
* They have been absolutely sideways for the past 12 months and down \~9% for the year.
* Things are going to look bad for this quarter that's a given.
* Apple Vision is not selling well (give that thing a controller and games my god)
* Regulators are breathing down their neck (I do feel some of it is justified regardless of what Cramer says)
* It's been absent in this AI bonanza - probably their worst offense

However, with all of that said there is one thing that Apple has in its perpetual back pocket.

Install Base &amp; Great Product recognition

Before I get into 2 companies that Apple will absolutely trounce, I want to talk about a prediction that is coming for their upcoming June developer conference.

Apple will 1000% announce their AI strategy. It is a foregone conclusion they will do this and in a meaningful way. If they don't do this it would be corporate malfeasance and Tim Cook should resign immediately. But why?

AI is something that YOU MUST get out the door and have people using it. It's not web search where you can make a deal with Google to use their AI offering. And BTW if you think that deal is going to happen with Google it 1000% is not. Apple would insane to do that. You have get your models up, trained and running. If you don't they can never improve. They can't get more training data. And, Apple is already reporting that they have models that are performing well.

~~To pay Google or anyone for Models when Meta is just releasing models for free right now is a non-starter. Apple will make their own AI models.~~

Apparently not. Apple is now talking to OpenAI too. So Apple using Microsoft. lol hmmm. Interesting.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/apple-intensifies-talks-with-openai-for-iphone-generative-ai-features?embedded-checkout=true](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/apple-intensifies-talks-with-openai-for-iphone-generative-ai-features?embedded-checkout=true)

The fact that Apple isn't even look to compete with their own models is just wild to me. 

As much as I wish Microsoft and or OpenAI would do a hardware device (regarding AI), Apple has the install base to do something meaningful and in a big way with consumers. Literally, this can be another vertical for Apple.

Other hardware, such as ""The PIN"" and ""the Rabbit"" are horrible devices. The Rabbit is OK but it is beyond obvious that your phone is going to be able to do what those devices do shortly. Literally, all Apple has to do is look at anything worthwhile on those devices, what's not worthwhile on them and come out with a future Iphone that does all that and more. It will be like taking candy from a baby.

Edge AI, in my opinion is going to be a great game changer and very practical use case for what profitable AI will look like. Whether it's a Robot or your HER / hand-held device edge AI is where this all goes.

Samsung has already begun AI on the phone and I don't really use it because of 1 reason. It's not a great foundational model like OpenAI's ChatGPT or anything good that is native on the phone. And this is the beautiful thing about Apple. If Apple can just be good enough with their AI models - They're opportunity is different than any other player in the mobile space. They can put a model that they make directly on the phone. True Edge AI. Nobody else has the opportunity to do that in the way Apple does. This will make the AI faster, more responsive, great computer vision, audio capabilities will all be native on the phone.

All for $20 / $30 a month that Apple sheep will be happy to pay for.

Look for Apple to begin that story this June.

26,wallstreetbets,"For you weak paperhands, who actually managed to lose money this week, CPNG may be your last chance","So after 6 straight days of red, and caving into your FOMO self, you chose **this** week to be a bear?

Look, I know all you downy looking regards are very talented at losing money,  but if you want to actually try **making** some money for once, I’ll let you in on some of my cooking 🍳

Okay great, the reason for the post today, is that something **just** came across my desk and it is perhaps the **best** thing I've seen in six months.

For all you uneducated burger flippers, let me tell you about CPNG (Coupang) a growing Korean e-commerce company. After taking a look at the charts on my robinhood app, I could tell that this stock has **HUGE** upside potential with **very little** downside. Their earnings are on **May 7th** and it could easily be one of those rare 1**0 baggers** we get every so often. 💰x10

The fair value for CPNG is estimated at $32.41 based on the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Meanwhile, it's trading at a measly $22.91. That means this stock is undervalued by a staggering 30% meaning it can moon, HARD. 🌕 🚀

For the intellectually challenged among you, let me explain the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to explain why I think this is. 🧠💡

Let’s Project CPNG's future free cash flows (FCF) for the next 10 years:

I’m not going to explain how inflation works to you poors, but generally, money is more valuable today than in ten years. Bottom line, you discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:

https://preview.redd.it/7wdna9rphwwc1.png?width=2636&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73befba8f4425a925cad0208c5fd71579c707c20

**Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)** = US$18b

Next is what you call Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. Now discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.1%.

\*\*Terminal Value (TV)\*\*= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.7b× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.3%) = US$79b

\*\*Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)\*\*= TV / (1 + r)10= US$79b÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$40b

Crunch the numbers and add up all the present values of CPNG's future cash flows, which gives us a total equity value of $58 billion💰💰💰

Now, here's where it gets juicy. Take that $58 billion and divide it by the number of shares outstanding and you will get $32.41.

Compared to the current share price of $22.91, and you'll realize this stock is undervalued by a whole 30%! 📈

Now, I know some of you are probably trembling in your Crocs, afraid to take the plunge. But **guess what**, betas don’t make money, they just choose a nice ETF like VOO after paperhanding on options **once**.

So, here's the deal. CPNG is practically begging you to buy it at this massive discount. Don't be a wimp, grab some calls and strap in, because this rocket is about to blast off to the moon, and leave you whining about how you can't achieve generational wealth.

TLDR; CPNG is undervalued by 30%, you neckbeards. If you don't go all-in right now, you'll be stuck working at Wendy’s while the rest of us count our tendies 💰🍟

28,wallstreetbets,Enovix corp (ENVX),"Energy materials scientist here. I researched batteries at NASA. Okay it was an internship but shaddap.  I'm a chemist who loves batteries and solar energy, and ~~gambles~~ dabbles in stonks like a goddamn idiot. Here's a hot take on Enovix Corp, a little company that thinks it could revolutionize the battery game. Strap in, degenerates.

# TL;DR:

Enovix Corporation (ENVX) is possibly maybe trust me bro shifting from underdog to top dog in the advanced battery sector. They are making next-gen silicon-anode lithium-ion batteries with major potential in high-demand markets like smartphones and EVs. Despite hemorrhaging cash like a thing that hemorrhages a lot of cash, they just hit a revenue spike in Q4 2023. Yet stonk price is close to their 52-week low, and their Q1 report is coming up soon, Setting up a moonshot or setting up for a spectacular crash? Fuck if I know.

# Financials and stonk mommy moves:

* **Cash burn vs. rocket fuel**: Enovix has been burning cash faster than you can say ""bankruptcy,"" with some negative EBITDA and net income that might scare off the faint-hearted. The net income has shown increasing losses, from about -$40 million in 2020 to -$214 million by end of 2023.
* **Debt disaster**: The total debt significantly increased from virtually none in 2020 to $191 million in 2023. The debt is stacking up like a Jenga tower right before Ryan Gosling tells you to shut the fuck up.
* **Revenue rollercoaster**: After a long period of couch change revenue, they jumped up to $7.4 million in Q4 2023, which could be the beginning of something bigger.
* **Manufacturing muscle**: They’re expanding with a new high-volume manufacturing hub in Malaysia. It's supposed to be coming online this month.
* **Strategic alliances**: They’ve got some hefty deals with top OEMs and a leading automaker *that shall remain nameless*, according to their most recent press release.

# Tech specs and market hype:

* **Battery breakthroughs**: They are producing batteries that have much higher capacity and longevity than what is currently on the market. At the same time, battery tech evolves at a breakneck pace, and competition is as brutal as Feyd-Rautha. Enovix needs to keep their edge sharp and scale efficiently without tripping over their own ambitions.
* **AI Demand Surge**: With AI tech slurping up power like a person who slurps up a lot of stuff, there’s a growing need for batteries. Enovix is stepping up, ready to provide more stuff to be slurped by the person slurping stuff.

# Bottom Line:

Enovix is swinging for the fences with high-stakes tech innovation and strategic expansions. It’s a textbook high-risk, high-reward play.

29,wallstreetbets,FANG - The Hidden Gem in the Oil Patch About to Explode? 🚀🚀,"Let’s talk about Diamondback Energy (FANG), which looks primed for a sick run as we slide into earnings next week. Here’s why you might wanna yolo into this bad boy:

&amp;#x200B;

1.**Beating the Street:** Last quarter, FANG knocked it outta the park with an EPS of $4.74, beating estimates by $0.13. Revenue was up too, hitting $2.23 billion against the $2.16 billion expected. [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/) Consistency? Check.

&amp;#x200B;

2. **Valuation Vibes:** With a trailing PE of 11.89 and a forward PE of just 11.37, FANG’s sitting pretty as potentially undervalued. This isn't some overpriced tech stock; it’s got the earnings chops to back up its price [(stockanylysis)](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/fang/statistics/).

&amp;#x200B;

3. **Institutional Love:** Big money’s been moving around here. Larson Financial Group and several other big players have been upping their stakes, a good sign of institutional confidence [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&amp;#x200B;

4. **Dividend Delight:** FANG isn’t just about growth; it pays to hold, too. They recently bumped their dividend to a tasty $3.08 per share quarterly, which translates to a fat yield of 6.08% annually. That’s some serious cheddar while you wait for the stock to moon [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&amp;#x200B;

5. **Future Forecast:** Analysts are seeing sunny skies ahead with EPS estimates climbing to $20.92 next year. If they're even close to right, we're looking at solid growth [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&amp;#x200B;

6. **Technical Tea Leaves:** The stock has rallied over 30% YTD and recently traded around $202.58. It’s above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a bullish sign for those of you who like your charts [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, as with any oil play, there's volatility from oil price swings and market moods, but FANG seems positioned well. With earnings on the horizon, this could be a prime setup for a classic WSB YOLO. Remember, this ain’t financial advice, just one ape’s take on a stock that’s looking juicy. Manage your risk and maybe we ride this rocket together to the moon. 🚀

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** FANG’s got the goods—solid earnings beat, undervalued stock, big dividends, and institutional backing. Could be time to strap in before earnings next week.

30,wallstreetbets,BoomerDD - McFlation - watch this dividend giving stock to read the future of the market!,"McDonalds 🍟 earnings are coming of April 30th and that's BIG news for our Casino 🎰

  
In Q4 of 2023 McDonalds started to see faltering in previously strong growth citing consumer's rejecting their affordability as one of the main drivers.  This was one of the first signals that consumer pressure is starting to impact corporate grabs at margin which has continued as a theme through other major earnings calls:

Exhibit 1 PepsiCo: 

&gt;In the U.S., lower-income consumers are still trying to stretch their paychecks, Pepsi CEO Ramon Laguarta told analysts on the company’s conference call. Pepsi is trying to target the demographic and keep them as customers, particularly for its snacks like Cheetos 🤢.

  
Exhibit 2 Walmart:   


&gt;The food business has a number that are showing up quite as well, so really key items that we know that our customers have responded to well. We took our French bread 🥖 back to $1 which had been $1 for a long time and went up as inflation hit the market. And we're seeing results of that running about 40% over last year, so customers immediately responded. Rotisserie chicken 🍗 is another one. That price has come down by $1. Customers are responding.

  
It's becoming clear that Ameri-Fats  are not happy with the state of inflation and have been considering extreme measures like limiting their food intake to below 3000 calories a day.🤬This is a bad situation for u/ChrisKempzinski (CEO of McDonalds) and the world is waiting to see if he can present a plan to bring back actual value to the VALUE meal.   If McDonalds shows signs that it will cave to consumer pressure to possibly lose some ground on margins (or a supply chain optimization effort to accomplish the same thing) then it is likely we are going to start seeing larger movements in inflation in the coming months.   If Ameri-Fats start seeing strong offerings on Big Macs, Cheetos, and Rotisserie Chickens other competitors in the market will need to start looking at the 'greed' driven margins in their profits seriously.  

Everyone needs to stop worrying about trivial tech based dividendless goons who haven't innovated anything in years.   MCD is your true leading indicator and you don't even need to dump $50k on options before it comes out to make a profit.   Just wait for the report and look at their plans to address affordability and attract customers, if aggressive pricing is on the table then expect inflation to start showing major signs of progress and increased confidence of fed rate hikes THIS YEAR.    

Early confidence in Rate hikes means you can just YOLO into the Dow Jones with LEAPs and expect major profits before 2025.   ",0.65,9,0,9,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'DD'}]"
31,wallstreetbets,Hell is coming. For Chipotle (CMG),"CMG has run up 69% since the October 2023 lows, and I believe hedge funds are looking to exit at around this level. Notice the heavy selling on 3/20 once price hit $3000. Looming 50:1 stock split is not until June so no worries about the poors pumping the stock. 

**Catalyst:**
Earnings today after close. As you may know, California recently raised its minimum wage for chain fast food companies to $20/hr, and it just took effect beginning of April. Chipotle has had to raise its prices there (again), and now people are paying $12-15 for a gentrified burrito. With the repeated price increases and the possible staff reductions, Becky might decide to visit an actual Mexican restaurant. California makes up 14% of their locations, so while this will not end their bloodline, I believe they may update their guidance in this earnings call. Whoever the hell is buying at this price is paying out 5-7 years worth of potential growth in advance. 

**Hedge Funds:**
Ackman reduced position in Q4 2023, and it's not yet known if he sold any in Q1 2024 yet because 13F's are not out yet. Maybe that was him on 3/20?

**Potential risks:**

• Price increases may lead to increased revenue if people don't stop coming in.

• They may use minimum wage as an excuse to reduce staff, reducing payroll costs to slave drive the shit out of 1 remaining worker behind the counter, leading to possible increased earnings.

• I am just a regard like you and I have no idea what I'm talking about.

32,wallstreetbets,"Let's discuss Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, $FNMA and $FMCC","I have no idea what I am doing, but maybe somebody smarter than me  can do something with this information. I am also too regarded to input  images. This is my first post ever. Please be gentle fellow regards. **THIS IS NOT A SHORT TERM PLAY. Only shares atm.** 

Do you remember the housing market crash in 2008? Me neither! Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been under government conservatorship through the FHFA since September 2008. [This article](https://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/when-will-government-control-of-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac-end-part-2)  written in 2022 is part 2 of a well written future outlook for the two  mortgage lending giants that were on the front lines during the 2008  housing crash. As I understand it, in order for the two companies to  escape from the conservatorship, they must first raise enough capital to  IPO, which is a massive undertaking. However, things are slowly looking  up. In 2019 the Trump administration authorized the two companies to  start building capital again by accruing retained earnings. Their  combined equity is cresting 100 billion. [It is thought that for both companies to IPO, a combined 150 billion dollars in capital would be required](https://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/when-will-government-control-of-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac-end-part-2),  which is thought to be massive for an IPO. I believe these two  companies are in for massive gains in the upcoming years as they  continue to rebuild their coffers and potentially exit conservatorship.

  

But don't take my  word for it. Do a one year chart comparison of  the two companies (I would have included that, but I am so god damn  regarded). You might notice that things started to pick up around August  of 2023. I did some digging to find out what was going on around that  time, and lo and behold, [a  federal jury ruled in favor $FMCC and $FNMA, stating that the sweeping  of all their profits into the US treasury due to an amended stock  purchase agreement in 2012 was unconstitutional.](https://www.bsfllp.com/news-events/bsf-prevails-at-trial-in-decade-long-battle-against-fhfa.html) 

&amp;#x200B;

These two companies are in control of \~**7 trillion dollars worth of assets (**[$FNMA](https://companiesmarketcap.com/fannie-mae/total-assets/#google_vignette) [$FMCC](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL404090423A)) combined. I have no idea what that means, but those are pretty big  numbers right? Too big to fail, in fact? One might think....   

With the housing market going crazy, [and a potential Trump win which would be highly favorable for FNMA and FMCC](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-18/a-trump-reelection-seen-as-bullish-for-fannie-freddie-shares),  these are two stocks that I think we should all have our eyes on, as  they seem fairly undervalued at the moment. People have forgotten about  them, and they shouldn't.   

[Here is an excellent interview transcript from the CEO of Fannie Mae, Priscilla Almodovar](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-ceo-fannie-mae-believes-100000781.html).  She is a relatively new CEO (2022 instated) as is the CEO of Freddie  Mac for that matter. She speaks very optimistically about the road ahead  for FNMA, and discusses the lessons learned over the past 15 years. [There](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-19/fannie-mae-ceo-discusses-government-conservatorship-of-gse) [are](https://www.insidemortgagefinance.com/articles/230137-anticipation-grows-for-end-of-gse-conservatorship?v=preview) [so many god damn](https://www.crefc.org/cre/content/News/Items/advocacy-items/Fannie_Mae_Envisions_Independence_from_Government_Control.aspx) [paywalled  articles from this year or last year in which the CEO and important  people are talking about the end of conservatorship](https://www.insidemortgagefinance.com/articles/230116-the-gses-have-been-profitable-since-2012-maybe-its-time-to-end-the-conservatorships?v=preview). So annoying.   

Options are not available for these two companies (maybe that has  something to do with the conservatorship, I have no idea), but the  shares I believe are extremely undervalued for what they could become  down the road. Please don't take this as advice.   

I have $2000 invested in both $FNMA and $FMCC for a total of $4000  because that's what I can afford right now. I would share a picture, but  the insert image button is not working.  ",0.85,18,0,18,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'DD'}]"
33,wallstreetbets,About that Falling Knife - Tesla,"It's time boys and girls. Earnings season is back and there is one sharp knife in the collection. TSLA. Yep, the price action on this is insane towards the $150 April 26th puts.

Who here has leveraged their house on a third HELOC at 9.66% to buy into the downside of this fantastic firesale? I know I have.

Nothing can stop this train wreck to coming to a completion after tomorrow's earnings.

What wild and crazy thing will Elon say that can save this ship from an impending port side collapse?

Look no further than previous earnings calls to get a load of what might be in store.

&gt;If interest rates come down quickly, I think margins will be good and if they don't come down quickly they won't be that good,"" he said. ""We have lots of people who want to buy our car, but simply can't afford it.

I don't know Mr. Musk, Ford motor company is offering the Mach E for 0.00 apr financing for 72 months. Interest rates aren't coming down anytime soon so the notion that Musk can call out to full year guidance isn't even a realistic thing. Interest rates aren't coming down at all so kiss those margin lips goodbye.

What's crazy is why wouldn't he offer 0.00% financing considering when you buy a Tesla you lose about 30% in value as soon as you drive it off the lot.

What about this doozy of a foresight

&gt;It's a longshot worth taking because the payoff potential is very high, but it's not a sure thing at all. It's a high-risk, high-payoff program,"" Musk said. ""Dojo is working and it is doing training jobs; we are scaling it up and we have plans for Dojo 1.5, Dojo 2 and Dojo 3. It's got potential but can't emphasize enough: high risk, high payoff.

I don't know, Jensen Huang said he has this ready for any car company to develop and tailor to their needs. All they have to do is buy the ""chips"".

[Nvidia Drive](https://preview.redd.it/e64uokb6t4wc1.png?width=1537&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbcc23c246f35290643393cc6d021d4df14fde7b)

Nvidia drive is getting trained by synthetic data in a digital twin. All that data capturing by Tesla owners will be nothing compared to the endless synthetic situations that can train the Nvidia drive platform along with data capture.

The point is, Robotaxis aren't going to be a only Tesla thing. They will be an entire automotive autonomous driving thing for many players.

This is devastating because while Mr. Musk may mention Robotaxis 1000 times on this earnings call it will ring hollow to the rest of the industry listening. Yeah, we can do that too.

And all of that is before 1 law even allows Robotaxis to exist in the first place. Look for that legislation to pass in 2030 in the shortest period possible once they prove this technology won't kill people.

But there's more

Tesla is building robots too and they should be ready next year. Again, Jensen Huang just eating that lunch. See here's a thing that some of you didn't know. Story time. Once upon a time Elon invested in a company called OpenAI. After some infighting, arguing and things happening Elong decided to give OpenAI and ultimatum if they wanted to continue to exist. He told them to fold OpenAI into Tesla and they were like Nah bro we good.

In a big brain smooth move Elon said ok and peaced out.

So the thing that could power Optimus's brain in the best way is not at Tesla. It's at Microsoft. Good one Elon.

&gt;After spending the past year teasing continuous upgrades to Tesla's Optimus project, Musk said that the company has a chance of shipping ""some number of Optimus units next year."" 

So what does it all mean? If you ask me I say the chickens are coming home to roost.

If Tesla can't maintain the last blockade of selling pressure of $138 - $135 the dam will break and this stock goes to $100 in a matter of weeks.

Matter of weeks? Mmm, maybe a matter of days.

In the end, it was just a car company. Do I think this is the end of Tesla? No, I think it's a great company. It may just be time for a leadership change and a massive investment in charging stations with a 0.00% apr buy down so they can sell units and FSD.

I do think they can turn things around but let's be clear. There is no amount of fairy dust Musk can put on this pig in the short term. He's going to have to work his way out of it. The competition is fierce and the headwinds are coming for Tesla like we've never seen before.

I don't know who is still shitting out fantasy numbers and price points of $294 but you have to be kidding. Or who's saying this has the opportunity to be largest and greatest tech company in the world. This ain't it.

Cathy Wood has stopped buying Tesla and Wedbush is about off this train too. You can make money off of this too. Don't miss this falling knife hit the floor.

here's the price action and it's a sight to behold

34,wallstreetbets,$MARA is about to explode,"Despite a massive bull run for bitcoin, the bitcoin miners have lagged significantly.  The halving may be a reminder for spot holders that their asset won't be inflated away, but it's also a warning for miners that their income stream is being cut in half every four years.  If you're new to bitcoin, the bitcoin miners have two sources of revenue: transaction fees, and block rewards.

Historically, most of the revenue for bitcoin miners has come from the block rewards, ie the new bitcoin being created by the protocol.  The block rewards were cut in half on 4/20, aka the halvening.  Fees don't make much money for miners:

&amp;#x200B;

[bitcoin fees as a &amp;#37; of total block rewards](https://preview.redd.it/b0ddnytabtvc1.png?width=1353&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34652730f25848f864830e86404ed0115ff0fb95)

As you can see, user fees as a percent of miner revenue has been close to zero for most of bitcoin's history.  Since the block subsidy is being cut in half every four years, the future appears grim for the bitcoin miners.  Wall Street rates them holds or sells.  But what's that historically huge spike we just saw on 4/20?  That, my fellow regards, was caused by the *Runes* protocol, which went live along with the halving.

Long story short, Runes is an attempt to bring NFTs to Bitcoin.  Anyone paying attention to crypto at all the past couple years will know the potential mania that might come with this.  It hints that bitcoin could be a long-term threat to Ethereum, something most analysts don't consider, and it's causing a dramatic surge in demand for bitcoin block space right now.

Here's the realtime bitcoin fee data:

&amp;#x200B;

[recent bitcoin transaction fees intraday](https://preview.redd.it/optlsmkvctvc1.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2fcd990ab19a029c3e45e9c23d84460bcafdd58)

You can see that fees per block have moved substantially higher post-halving, compared with the previous week, a period that was already showing elevated user fees compared with bitcoin's history.  The demand for bitcoin block space is increasing exponentially, and this bodes well for bitcoin's future.

$MARA Marathon Digital is the market cap leader in bitcoin mining, and has been very profitable as bitcoin has been going up.  EPS of $1.08 in the past year, low debt to equity, all with bitcoin at prices well below current levels.  Meanwhile, US bitcoin ETFs have been the most successful launch in history.  ETFs were just approved in Hong Kong as well.  Bitcoin will be the world's first global money.  Now with Runes, the narrative that the miners will struggle because nobody actually uses bitcoin will take a serious hit.  So you're going to see three things happening simultaneously in the next quarter:

&amp;#x200B;

1. the bitcoin price is going to rip higher, as high net worth individuals and small companies start allocating assets to bitcoin, following a still-building wave of Wall Street marketing, helped by...
2. ... the anti-bitcoin narrative that miners can't be profitable long-term and therefore the asset security model is broken takes a big hit, since...
3. ... demand for block space will be rising significantly, providing a much rosier outlook for the long-term future of bitcoin miners which will lead to ...
4. ... analyst upgrades, as bitcoin miners will be reporting record earnings due to increased fees and rapidly rising bitcoin price

&amp;#x200B;

With earnings going up AND P/E multiples widening, the upside potential for $MARA is huge.  Now the cherry on top, the grim outlook for miners has created a significant short interest of 18% of the float, \~43 million shares short. 

&amp;#x200B;

Between a new wave of insane bitcoiners FOMO'ing into NFTs at any price, shorts covering, and legitimately increasing revenue and prospects for the company, imo this one is a firecracker set to pop.

36,wallstreetbets,PARA Thesis - No Deal and No Merger Outlook,"This thesis builds on continued earnings growth from Q3 and Q4 of 2023. I am anticipating EPS of between $0.75 and $1.00 for Q1 2024 and forward guidance of $1B to $2B in earnings for 2024. I believe Paramount Global is trading at a discount when you factor EPS improvements from the last two quarters and trading at a 13x/14x PE on that basis. 

If we take away any deal aspect, Paramount is undervalued when compared to competitors. I would consider most competitors to be trading at a PE of 18x, while the industry average for the entertainment sector is 35x. Given market conditions, I would tie it to the PE of 18x which would be approximately an $13 near term price target and overall if forward guidance stays in line, a price target of $30 to $40 conservatively by 2025.

I think the reason for the discounted share price is shrouded by current deal talks with Skydance which would require some level of dilution for Paramount to acquire Skydance at a pretty ridiculous valuation of $4B to $5B. I’m fairly confident the Skydance deal won’t be reached if everything that has been reported as rumors is the entirety of the deal. I would paraphrase the DD talks between Paramount and Skydance going like this,

Paramount Special Committee: Why do you think Skydance is valued at $4B to $5B?

Skydance and Ellison: Because we said so.. 

Overall, bullish on Paramount. I think it’s trading in undervalued territory. Q1 earnings is coming early on April 29th by comparison to past reporting dates. Do with this what you will! 

Edit 1: To elaborate on the potential deal aspects, David Ellison is essentially trying to make a deal to acquire NAI and the PARA A shares from Shari Redstone. He is also wanting to merge Skydance and Paramount which most rumors reported it being dilutive to common shareholders and beneficial for Shari and/or all voting shareholders. He’s also trying to value Skydance at $4B to $5B based on funding raised, but in my opinion, if Skydance was listed publicly with current revenues, would get absolutely shit on at that valuation based on their revenue (not evening earnings). 

Apollo has submitted a $26B all cash deal for equity and debt and Byron Allen has discussed potentially a $30B all cash deal. Between the two, the average share price range for commons would be about $17 to $22 per share. 

Subscriptions for Paramount+ were growing steadily last year and Paramount per their last earnings forecasted profitability for their streaming segment by 2025. Overall, I think that Paramount could start selling off some of its linear elements and reduce debt as well throughout the year and improve valuation metrics pretty readily in that sense.

https://preview.redd.it/vj3xes4yl5vc1.png?width=1334&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=049dd3ace3b2e16cc74be9214dd0384c3fd2cc55

A measly 8,300 million yen needed to meet their Q4 goal, and most importantly they released major new IP in their Q4 fiscal year. 

Enter Dragon's Dogma 2. Now I won't subject you to all my terrible algebra, but with an estimated 2.5 million units sold and a price point of $70 per title as well as some complicated assumptions for margin... I estimate they roughly hit about 12,000 million yen in operating income from this new IP alone, with probably about another 8,000 million in their 'catalog' title sales. A healthy amount of that 8,000 million yen estimate is coming from a huge resurgence of popularity in their Monster Hunter World title in Q1. 

That puts us at about 20 million yen operating income for their Q4. 

In the trailing twelve months that means it will be replacing this pretty number here. 

[All Yen in thousands](https://preview.redd.it/0my5xay3n5vc1.png?width=1509&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b29faed9362bf43290e5b6c5f276476a77036b55)

This should give us a new TTM of about 68,000 million yen. Significantly better than the 56,000 million yen forecast! 

Now what effect will this have on the price? Well with their significant margin growth, and high value IP including a new mainline monster hunter title coming in their Q4 2024 forecast. I believe this company to be worth a P/E of at least 25-30 when comparing to similar industry peers. 

That puts us at a 15 - 35 % jump over the current share price, in what I consider a play with minor downside and probably a very strong positive upside if you are looking out to Q4 2024 (Remember in Japan that is end of March 2025.)

Also, if you decide to enter into this trade, beware of CCOEY having less than desirable volatility, make sure to use limit orders. ",0.82,11,0,11,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'DD'}]"
38,wallstreetbets,DD on Zoetis (ZTS): risk reward looking attractive here??,"This is my first DD so please be gentle😊

The recent plunge of ZTS was due to a WSJ article published on 04/12:

[https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/dog-cat-arthritis-drugs-bcdddea6](https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/dog-cat-arthritis-drugs-bcdddea6)

Quote: ""The FDA received more than 3,800 reports of side effects concerning the drugs through the end of last year. The European Medicines Agency has received more than 12,300 reports of side effects involving Librela and more than 7,700 for Solensia since 2021, when the drugs went on sale in Europe. The figures include reports from the U.S. and other countries outside of the European Union.""

But a 04/15 Morgan Stanley survey of 75 US vets found: ""Almost all respondents (98%) already prescribe or plan to prescribe ZTS' Librela (canine pain) and Solensia (feline pain) with over half naming Librela (63%) and/or Solensia (36%) as the most impactful new products. On recent concerns over Librela side effects, *only 4% of practitioners are concerned enough to be deterred from prescribing Librela, 83% have some level of concern but still prescribe, and 13% are not at all concerned.* ""

Vet surveys done by JPM and BofA had very similar findings.

Critically, Librela &amp; Solensia are prescription drugs so the vets opinions matter the most.

Also per Morgan Stanley:

* ""we estimate WW mAbs sales (Librela and Solensia) contribute $0.73 to our FY24 EPS (13% of total) and $1.01 to our FY25 EPS (16%)"" -- on the day of the WSJ story the stock plunged 7.8%, pricing in roughly 50% reduction of the mAbs sales already?? This overreaction is clearly not supported by the vet surveys.
* ""the implied valuation without all pain mAbs globally (a harsh assumption, but for analysis purposes), would be 27.6x FY25 at the current share price, still below its 10-year historical average of 29.2x, suggesting the stock may be overly punished.""

Lastly, let's look at the technical side. ZTS is currently at critical support levels on the weekly chart. If it continues to hold these levels, I think the risk reward from here will look very attractive!

39,wallstreetbets,Why RDDT is going to surprise on earnings in 4 charts,"I have a history of making niche websites and it was my main source of income up until about a year ago when I made a bit of a pivot.  Since then Google has released a couple of updates and it's absolutely annihilated most of my niche content.  

This has been bad for me, but great for large content producers like Reddit, Medium, Quora, etc who have all seen their organic traffic absolutely skyrocket in the past 6 months.  Google's Helpful Content Update (HCU) has pushed out a lot of frankly pretty bad websites like mine in favor of content that is verified by other users or from a larger site.  To give you a bit of an idea of the scale of this, here is a graph showing the assumed traffic to [Reddit.com](https://Reddit.com) from SEMrush.  This isn't exact and Reddit would have better numbers, but it showcases the absolutely stratospheric amount of traffic that Reddit is getting over the past 6 months.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y87yiv0wi4vc1.jpg?width=887&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25a831855089be16e1530816cb8b279d5c7f366e

Now here is Reddit's traffic from their own S-1 form over the past couple of years.  Note that the number of app users in Red increases slowly, but the number of non-logged in users increases and decreases in correlation with the SemRUSH graph.  That last little dip before it rockets to the moon is June 2023 which correlates with the logged out drop in Q2 2023 (29.2 million to 28.3 million).  

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tvjkdp0aj4vc1.jpg?width=689&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ef51808ae2885cd467ef424c8ec08cbd60af93c

You can see that by **FAR** the largest increase is in Q4 2023 which is only halfway up that SEMrush crayon line.  Reddit should easily see 40 million non-logged in daily users in Q1 if the trend continues.  These users all have a chance to convert into degenerates like you and me, but it doesn't really matter because that Daily Average Unique User is going to look sexy AF to investors when RDDT drops it's next earnings.

# But really it doesn't matter how many people log in or view the website because Reddit has never made money and can't monetize it's users.

Well, you're wrong about that too.  RDDT is on a path to monetize it's user base and has made a bunch of strides in the right direction in terms of advertising.  Anecdotally the quality of ads I've been receiving has been a lot better in the past year. 

# BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER

Advertising is a marketplace and just like the stock market it goes up and down over the course of a year.  Reddit's advertising is much more tied to the intrinsic cost of advertising than it is anything they are doing internally.  They even mention it in their S-1 "" We experience seasonality in our business and financial results. Overall advertising spend tends to be highest in the fourth quarter of each year due in large part to end-of-year advertiser spending and lowest in the first quarter of each year. In addition, we believe our strong growth in prior periods has made it difficult to evaluate the impact of seasonality on our business, and we expect seasonality to become more pronounced in the future as our business matures. ""

To draw this out in a format you're used to you can check out this chart from Ezoic. I really dislike the company, but I do love their Ad Revenue Index which showcases your expected earnings showing display ads on a website.  This chart is a bit funky to read, but essentially it takes the highest mark on the day where you would expect to earn the most and then relates every other day to that.  

So as someone with a niche site, the best day for expected revenue was in November of 2021.  This was towards the end of Covid when the market was gearing back up, money was free, and Christmas was just around the corner.  That's why Q4 (November especially) is always the best for advertising companies (Christmas), and then it absolutely shits the bed in the New Year.  This happens EVERY year, except for this one.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q4o0d1tzl4vc1.jpg?width=1138&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95981bd9688da43c2b063010dad77086e8ec0ac5

You can play around with it here.

[https://nicheindex.ezoic.com/report#niche](https://nicheindex.ezoic.com/report#niche)

This year, there was the expected Christmas boom and then New Year hangover, but ad revenue is actually at the same or higher level than it was in November of last year.  This is unheard of and absolutely not the norm, but it relates to Christmas being a bit poor for advertising revenue this year while Q1 has actually been a bit strong for advertisers.

Now how does this relate to RDDT?

Well let's take a look, RDDT's revenue has been rising every year but it's Revenue is directly tied to the expected ad revenue.  If we pull their Quarterly Results of Operations data from their S-1 and take a look at 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5xnmh7crm4vc1.jpg?width=1255&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b97e1f962c1e39c8ba3f9b71354cf31c9e1e869e

In 2021 RDDT's revenue was 79 million for Q1, 108 million for Q2, 121 million for Q3, and 177 million for Q4.  This directly correlates with the ad revenue index where we would expect ad revenue to be roughly double (\~40th percentile to the \~80th percentile).  Then immediately into Q1 of the following year revenue drops from 177 million to 146 million which matches what we  see when comparing the chart.

Now what's interesting about this is that in 2024 we don't see that expected ad revenue drop in our ad revenue chart, in fact Q1 of 2024 might actually have a higher expected ad revenue than Q4 of 2023 especially in February and March.

So what happens when the Daily Average Unique users jumps up because Google has skyrocketed the organic users AND advertising revenue is higher AND you've improved your advertising platform?

Rocket meet moon.  RDDT is going to post a similar or larger revenue number to Q4 of last year showcasing 50+% revenue growth year over year and it's second profitable quarter in a row. Last Q1 they posted a revenue of 163 million, this Q1 I expect it to be right around the 250 mark and with revenue growing at three times the pace of costs this earnings report will knock your socks off.

41,wallstreetbets,$RL Ralph Lauren 10 bagger 2.0,"I’m going to provide periodic updates as we move along, as it’s a longer-term (for WSB anyways) trade. About a month until earnings. 

4/26 Market Close Update

So obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.

As part of my update, I’m going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.

Fundamentals:

The major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I'll continue to dissect why it's still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.

-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.

-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year's quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That's fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html 

-It's increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following: 

(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That's an expense that will hurt projected EPS. 

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday

(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter. 

(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That's 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown. 

(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we've seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)

(5) ""For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024."" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It's impossible.

(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That's uhhh, 100% of the LLC's shares as ""long-term strategy for estate planning"". Also, it's about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/node/20766/html

This is a remark in the last report 

Remarks:

Following the sale reported herein, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., is no longer a 10% beneficial owner and this reflects an exit filing by Lauren Family, L.L.C.

Headwinds:

-u/Financial-File-2412 may continue to post ""We are so fucking back"" and it would destroy our positions. On Wednesday in the earlier trading hours we saw the stock start to crater until he commented below, at which exact minute the stock rebounded.

-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.

-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.

Tailwinds:

-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you'd like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call. 

-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed. 

-GDP isn't as high as expectations. This isn't necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it's ultra bad and leads to stagflation.

Catalysts:

Unfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.

NOTE ON PRICE ACTION:

Since I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let's say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they're in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you'll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You'll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.

Stay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They're still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that's when you'll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.


That's it for now ---

4/19 Market Close Update
-So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn’t do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.

We see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike. 

We also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech. 

This of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).

-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don’t be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it’s pretty low volume. Today included. 

-Speaking of SMCI’s lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that’s when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there’s a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT’S the major catalyst we’re aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets. 

-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing ~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it’s wrong. But of course, market doesn’t dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It’s the analysts’ job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air. 

Other catalysts to look towards could be:
-god forbid, further war escalation 
-a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It’s a non-zero chance. 
-Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel. 

4/19 That’s it for now.

Original Post:

I'm here to announce that I've closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\_lauren\_rl\_is\_a\_10\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)

I had purchased in total \~$15,000 in OTM puts, they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.

When I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \~$188 to \~$159.

All-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.

And then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.

My DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:

# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot

Wage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.

# 2. Consumer debt has exploded

Holiday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.

# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled

You might think ""but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!"" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing &amp; clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)

It's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.

This is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)

**Macy's**

Plus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.

# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)

This is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).

[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)

Also included within the article is this statement

 *""Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss* [*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N) *and Ralph Lauren* [*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N) *have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.""*

Which is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).

It's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).

# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)

# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically. 

Despite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched. Young adult unemployment is really high (despite whatever is being reported), anecdotally I work at a Chinese financial company and they all their relatives are complaining that the economy is ice cold still.

# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked

As you can see, RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.

[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)

Further, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.

8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff

The stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.

**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data. 

The guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.

RL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \~$192. 

The current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.

Finally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.

I suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.

Within the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).

There's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.

TL;DR

RL will gap down, get puts. 

PRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.

(Note: I know that I am massively wrong about my predictions with SPY and QQQ in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17owsky/dd_scary_fast_to_a_recession_next_year/), but the AAPL prediction did come true? See P.S. below for more details)

# Introduction

""If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will be everywhere weak."" - Sun Tzu

As mentioned in a previous post, Apple (AAPL) is currently trying to defend its market position in multiple fronts:

1. Lagging hardware sales in Macs and iPads globally, which compose Apple's ecosystem beyond the iPhone
2. The Greater China Region in general, which is the iPhone (and other products') #2 market, only behind the US itself
3. Services and Software, which serves as an engine for growth amid aforementioned plateauing and stagnating hardware sales, are currently engaged in legal entanglements with the EU and the US

There is a great breadth of markets, both product and geography-wise, listed above. But Mr. (Let Him) Cook is only one chef: if there can only be a single story for a coherent market defense, a single place where he can go on a charm defensive, where will it be?

It will have to be in China, where all of the decelerating markets stated above intersect: [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-boss-tim-cook-visiting-shanghai-2024-03-20/)

However, the main point of the trip seems to be something else entirely - Apple Vision Pro (II): [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-vision-pro-hit-mainland-china-this-year-state-media-says-2024-03-24/)

Surely the Apple CEO himself wouldn't have the wind in his sail on the sea, just to lead with AVP in order to make AAPL strong?

# Supply Chain + Product + Market: Tim Cook's magic.

Long ago, Steve Jobs said that ""If It Weren't For Tim Cook, The iPad Would Have Cost $5,000."": [BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/if-it-werent-for-tim-cook-the-ipad-would-have-cost-5000-2012-3)

In terms of product market fit, the iPad is:

1. A great companion device, especially if a large screen is needed in a constrained space
2. Is mostly made for content consumption, but can do content creation with add-ons or in a pinch
3. Not as convenient as an iPhone in being ""an iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator""

Guess which product also does the above, currently costs in the ballpark of ""$5000"", and is not yet blessed with Tim's Magic?

I think most of you here can guess (although I have doubts if I say ""all""): **the** **AVP today has components mostly sourced in Japan**: [Nikkei](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-Vision-Pro-teardown-Japanese-companies-supply-40-of-parts)

I doubt Tim went to China himself just to secure a second market to a niche device; he went to secure a supply chain to continue making global devices, both AVP and existing products.

# The Magic Is No More: The Journey (Back) to the West

However, I don't think Tim Cook has made any headway with China: shortly after Tim Cook's trip, Apple suddenly pivots to the Enterprise market: [Apple PRFAQ](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/04/apple-vision-pro-brings-a-new-era-of-spatial-computing-to-business/)

This pivot, to me, smells of inadequate supply chain scale. Coupled with the fact that his next destinations were Vietnam and Indonesia, suggests that the talks in China, both from the supply and the market side, have reached relative deadlock: [APNews](https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-apple-tim-cook-supply-chain-e9a7581a127937a1958bebd434a47f25) [Quartz](https://qz.com/apple-ceo-says-company-is-looking-at-manufacturing-in-i-1851415116)

# M4: Loaded with AI or merely smokes and mirrors?

In another attempt to revive Mac sales, Apple is revamping its Mac lines with its new M4 chip, now with a ~~rushed~~ accelerated release date. However, I don't think it will make as big of a splash as hoped.

AI chips have two primary markets:

* **Enterprise**: Good luck with Apple on that, both in terms of internal culture and external competition / legal constraints - it would be a flagrant evasion of sanctions if M4 Mac Minis were suddenly all the rage in China.
* **Personal**: My current bottleneck is having more than 8gb RAM in my Macbook without selling my plasma, not a faster chip.

Given that Apple's R&amp;D spend is 22b as of Aug2023 ([BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apples-ai-research-spend-generative-2023-8)) with little to show thus far, it's very difficult to how Apple's current strategy is little more than just bandwagoning: Tim's behavior is looking more and more similar to the knee-jerk reactions made by other tech CEO's, particularly Sundar's.

# In conclusion

AAPL 5/17 165 Puts x 10

Target price on downside seems to be \~155 by earnings call based on volume spike on 5/3 155 Puts: [YahooFinance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/options/?straddle=true&amp;date=1714694400)

My current view is that Apple will not be able to execute on an AI-based ecosystem in order to differentiate its hardware to an ever-evolving software landscape, as that would require relinquishing too much control over its own platforms (see WebKit, Siri, sideloading, default apps, you name it), and its current product line will continue to stagnate as others rapidly commoditize and even out-innovate it in a challenging legal and market landscape.

43,wallstreetbets,Palantir ($PLTR): Preview of Possible Massive Commercial Expansion Ahead of Upcoming Earnings - Part 3 - DD,"Palantir has consistently offered robust and sophisticated software solutions, but deployment challenges have previously hindered widespread adoption. Recently, however, the company has introduced its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) product and bootcamp training programs, enabling faster and more streamlined implementation for customers. These initiatives have allowed some clients to emerge from the bootcamps with functional, value-adding products, addressing the deployment bottleneck that had previously constrained Palantir's exponential growth. With these advancements, the company is well-positioned to accelerate adoption and capitalize on the strength of its software offerings. I'm expecting big numbers on May 6th, 2024.

# Previously reported growth rates which were ok:

&amp;#x200B;

[Previously Reported Growth Rates](https://preview.redd.it/ilj8y4jpg3vc1.png?width=858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fc6fcca44b94923450e6171dce5ccf79798228c)

#  

# Analysis on projected commercial growth:

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies often employ subdomains to isolate and manage their clients' data and resources. By tracking the number of subdomains associated with a SaaS product, one can gain insight into its adoption rate and growth trajectory. Based on my analysis of subdomain data over an extended period, it appears that Palantir, a prominent data analytics firm, is poised for substantial growth in its customer base and market presence.

&amp;#x200B;

[Estimate based on subdomain analysis](https://preview.redd.it/j0qilgg5h3vc1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e6f73baf83f97e48ebae61a0f27b3e0593a0af1)

&amp;#x200B;

 

Even if only half of the additions turn into permanent customers these numbers are going to be massive.

**Here is what I used for the source data of subdomain data:**

[https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl/scans/2024-04-15/palantirfoundry.com](https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl/scans/2024-04-15/palantirfoundry.com)

First, I extracted the data relevant for the analysis—subdomains for each snapshot—and then calculated how many new customers appeared in Q1 2024.

In Q1 2024, Palantir acquired a total of 333 new customers. The monthly breakdown was as follows:

•	January: 81 new customers

•	February: 105 new customers

•	March: 147 new customers

This showed an increasing trend in customer acquisition as the quarter progressed. To forecast the number of new customers for Q2 2024, I used this growth trend. I calculated the monthly growth rates and applied them to predict the number of new customers in the upcoming months of Q2 2024.

For Q2 2024, the projected number of new customers for Palantir, based on the growth rates from Q1 2024, was as follows:

•	April: Approximately 198 new customers

•	May: Approximately 267 new customers

•	June: Approximately 360 new customers

Overall, Palantir was projected to acquire around 826 new customers in Q2 2024. This forecast assumed a consistent growth rate similar to what was observed in Q1 2024. Keep in mind, actual results may vary depending on market conditions, company strategy, and external factors.

* Lockheed won a $17 BILLION dollar Missile Defense contract

Now you typical Red Candle Lickers would start buying shares in LMT but this is REGARDED short sighted behavior. Because that 17B isnt profit, it has to be used to R&amp;D, test ,build and most importantly SOURCE MATERIALS for the project. So here comes the play!!!

The real winner of these defense contracts is the suppliers of the actual advanced composite materials. They will actually see the real profit of these contracts. And the best one in the business HEXCEL. (HXL)

* The ""street"" pretended to not like the news of the new CEO and sold off 20% in a single day. fueck em!! all this means is that HXL has a huge margin of safety built in. This aint a damn meme stock boys

46,wallstreetbets,Ford ($F) possible 20x bagger coming up 🤑 4/24,"Hello Regards. Been trying to get the word out on Ford earnings for three days and keep getting my DD knocked down so here comes a long ass post in an attempt to get it to stick - because it ain’t no fun if the homies can’t have none!

**The Scoop:** Ford Motor Company, makers of EV’s, Hybrids and ICE cars has earnings coming up after market close on April 24th. 

Ford has been steadily gaining ground after a HUGE dropoff between Jan 2022 and June 2022 due to supply chain production issues and inflation worries that affected the entire auto industry. The stock is currently in an upward trend headed towards earnings and bounced off a major support around $12.

Most recently in Q1 2024 they touted that their Hybrid sales were up 42% representing the best quarter ever for them, supported by increased sales in almost all their other lines. Ford is also the #1 truck seller in America (F150). Additionally Ford is America’s #2 EV seller. They have a full lineup of vehicles, and have been around since dinosaurs walked the earth.

But here’s the kicker: While Tesla and other EV makers have been seeing their EV sales DECLINE, Ford has been seeing their EV sales INCREASE. With the transition from ICE to EV, this is very much a growth stock now, with **shitfucktons** of room to go. That’s a lot.

Ford’s F150 Electric Sales for instance were up +80% in Q1, this on the back of +74% sales in Q4 2023. And this isn’t even factoring in the 500k cars and 6.8% growth they saw in Q1 on all of their cars combined.

**Source:** This guy breaks it down even further here: 

https://youtu.be/ayWtbehZ8zg?si=Z-75W7Fd7MNxiVqb

**Main bullet points that got me in:**

*The Jan 2022 price was $25.87. Currently the price is $12.14. That’s a massive amount of growth potential on a seasoned Automobile stock that’s likely going to surpass the Jan 2022 price one day. 

*Short Float only 3.6% - Dirty hedge scumbags can’t tank this $10/share and you lose your entire ass in the blink of an eye.

Source: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&amp;p=d#google_vignette

*Cybertruck FOMO - People priced out of Cybertruck that wanted an EV Truck can get an F150 Lightning for half the price of a CT, and not have to wait 3 years to get it. To me this is the strongest case. It’s like Meta’s Quest 3 vs Apple’s Vision Pro. Meta rode the coat-tails of Apple for one of the largest earnings rips of 2023, by providing the non-hype version of a product that does the same shit, and even does some shit better.

*Dirt Cheap Options for degens and regards. And Cheap Stocks for those a little less regarded. Currently $14.5-$15+ calls on 4/26 are $0.01 asks. If you look at the options chain, a big earnings beat and a $2 move means a 20x gain. A $3 move means your wife’s boyfriend will cry himself to sleep after he sees how big your newfound fortune is. You can buy him a Cybertruck that he’ll get sometime in 2028.

*Huge Call OI - almost 65%

*Ford is a Boomer Dividend Stock. It’s a safety net and familiar. Barring a nuclear attack where stocks don’t matter and we’re all dead, a Middle East conflict may not affect this stock as much as other auto makers that are more reliant on foreign parts. Ford is not immune, but better off for sure.

**Bonus Conspiracy Theory:** Suspicious options chain with 45k $12.82c and 30k $13.82c expiring on 4/19. That’s a lot of calls this week with weird as hell strike prices and weird as hell open interest compared to other strikes, almost like somebody knows something 🧐

**Bonus Conspiracy Theory 2:** Connected to the above, it’s possible Ford may announce a stock buy-back before or on the earnings call, which will raise the share price. So whomever is balls deep in those calls might still exercise them if they don’t hit by Friday. Perhaps that was their plan? The $12.82 looks good though IMO. I think $13 close by Friday looks good if there’s no WW3 market panic, which seems to be fading rn. 

Conclusion: 
Solid Automaker that’s not going anywhere. Risk-reward for both shares and options is HUGE on a big earnings beat. Boomer Divi stock that’s also now a growth stock. 

My Positions: 
$14.5c x100 - 4/26
$15.5c x26 - 4/26
$15c x150 - 4/26
$13.5c x23 - 5/3

I guarantee this will be talked about everywhere the next news we get and when that happens and you can come back to this post and thank me. Hello people from the future.

Mods ban me permanently from this sub if this doesn’t go to $40 by July 12. !banbet ALCC $40 7/12/2024.

Clean energy + Sam Altman. That is literally the only thing that matters in all of this. Stop overthinking all of the variables. Literally nothing matters in the current market outside of hype.

S-4/A filed yesterday - what that means? Couldn’t tell you. But you know that guy who created that little tiny thing CHAT FREAKING GPT??? Sam Altmans name is all over this.

“On September 14, 2023, AltC filed a definitive proxy statement (the ""Extension Proxy Statement"") with the SEC in connection with its solicitation of proxies for a special meeting of AltC's shareholders (the ""Special Meeting""), which further describes the proposal to amend AltC's amended and restated certificate of incorporation, in the form set forth in Annex A to the Extension Proxy Statement, to extend the date by which AltC must consummate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to as a ""business combination"" from October 12, 2023 to July 12, 2024.”

The merger is planned to happened some time before July 12 or investors will get back ~$10.43/share. 

“Mr. Altman also (a) has an economic interest in 6,035,600 AltC founder shares and 700,100 AltC private placement shares through his ownership of a membership interest in the Sponsor (but does not beneficially own any shares of AltC capital stock), (b) beneficially owns 519,858 shares of Oklo Series A-3 preferred stock held by Hydrazine Capital II, L.P., and (c) has an economic interest in i) the 252,605 shares of Oklo common stock held by Y Combinator S2014, LLC, (ii) the 354,177 shares of Oklo Series A-1 preferred stock held by YC Holdings II, LLC and (iii) the 55,135 shares of Oklo Series A-2 preferred stock held by YCVC Fund I”

I don’t know math so can’t tell you the exact number but Sam has hundreds of thousands (or MILLIONS?) of shares in this. So I would think he’d want to see this company do well.

Oh yeah did I mention this is the guy that created chat gpt? That thing that even your great grandmother and taxi driver is talking about? Yeah that guy.

50,wallstreetbets,"$VFC : The North Face,Vans , Timberlands","## The Turnaround Story

VF Corp is one of the world's largest footwear, apparel, and accessories companies. It owns a portfolio of highly iconic brands, including The North Face, Vans, Timberland and Supreme, brands that wouldn’t be unfamiliar to your average American.

VF-Corp

## The Fall from Grace

The stock has crashed 88% from its 2021 all-time high of $100 per share and is currently trading at $12 per share. What has changed,you may ask ? The sell-off can be attributed to all of these factors( in chronological order)  :

1. Early 2019, VF Corp sold of their denim brands (Wrangler and Lee Jeans, now known as Kontoor Brands) as they thought they weren't core to their brand portfolio. Kontoor Brands have since shown resilient growth on the top and bottom line.
2. Dec 2020, they did a $2.1 billion debt-financed acquisition of Supreme, which has since resulted in approximately 800-900 million in impairment cost, and the company has yet to succeed in monetise the Supreme brand and synergise it with their other brands.
3. Over-ordering of inventories during COVID-19, resulting in the need to sell their Vans/Timberland/Dickies inventory at a discount.
4. Throughout 2022 to late 2023, Vans' sales deteriorated 15% year-over-year in 2022 and a further 22% year-over-year in 2023, resulting in an accumulated decline of 35% from peak Vans sales.
5. March 17 2022, FED begins rate hikes to curb inflation. Borrowing costs increased from 0.25% in March 2022 to 5.25% in July 2023. This affected the cost of financing for VFC given their growing debt pile and market participants reflected this by discounting the stock price.
6. In Dec 2022, Steve Rendle, the CEO at the time made a sudden exit from the company during a time of deteriorating sales. Company lost its direction and an interim CEO had to be put in place.
7. After 7 months, in July 2023, a new CEO, Bracken Darrell (former Logitech CEO), was put in place tasked to revitalise the brands, but he subsequently cut revenue and earnings guidance, cut the dividend yield from 4-6% ish  to 0.9%, and declared multiple asset write-down. This further crashed the stock price, while the company announced the ""Reinvent"" program, a 4 year plan to bolster growth.
8. As of October 2023, VFC had become a debt-ridden company (7 billion in debt) with upcoming debt maturities to refinance, making it highly susceptible to interest rate fluctuations. The US 10-Year Yield at that time hit a 52-week high of 5% in October 2023, and the stock slid to $13 (-87% from ATH).
9. In April 2024, VFC was dropped from all S&amp;P 500-related indices and the FTSE All-World Index due to its market cap falling into the small-cap category, further contributing to the slide in the share price.
10. On April 11, 2024, the Consumer Price Index (a measure of inflation) was higher than expected, pushing back the need for the FED to cut interest rates, and VFC's stock slid to a 15-year low of $12 per share, last seen during the 2018 Financial Crisis.  


## The Turnaround Opportunity

Despite the deteriorating sales, I believe the bottom is near, and the company has all the necessary components for a turnaround. 

Here's why:

## New CEO: Bracken Darrell

Bracken Darrell has an amazing track record in leading consumer product companies and elevating the consumer experience. He previously served as the CEO of Logitech for 10 years, during which time the share price increased tenfold. At Logitech, he strategically positioned the company into different markets, such as gaming (LogitechG) and video collaboration/live streaming tools, and oversaw the design of the most successful MX series. The tiny gaming business of Logitech, which started off at $40 Million grew to $1 Billion by the time he left. Logitech-MX series was founded during his tenure,Before Logitech, Darrell was at Procter &amp; Gamble, tasked with rejuvenating the sales of Old Spice's (male grooming products) to appeal to a younger demographic, which he successfully did. Darrell has a strong track record with companies that have lost its footing and needs new product lines to rejuvenate growth. This time is no different.

## VF Corp's 5-Point Turnaround Plan: ""Reinvent"" 

VF Corp under Bracken Darrell announced a transformation plan called ""Reinvent"" which addresses shareholders top priorities and will focus on brand building and revitalizaiton. Here are the core issues to be addressed :

1. **Deliver a Vans Brand Turnaround**: Reset the brand's purpose, target audience, product plan, and marketing approach, and introduce new products and reset the marketplace in Q3 and Q4 of 2024.
2. **Fix the Underperformance in the Americas Region**: Establish a new commercial organization and regional platform, similar to the strategy used in the EMEA region, to improve results over time.
3. **Reduce Debt and Strengthen the Balance Sheet**: This is a top priority. VFC at one point racked up 6.5 billion in debt. In the most recent quarter, VF benefited from inventory reduction and a slashed dividend. They are already reducing net debt substantially and plan to monetize non-core physical assets to pay down upcoming debt without refinancing.
4. **Lower the Cost Base**: Deliver $300 million in fixed cost savings through simplifying and right-sizing the company's structure, selling real estate assets in Switzerland, and addressing other non-strategic areas.
5. **Strategic Review of the Brand Portfolio**: Sell off non-core brands, such as Kipling, Eastpak, and Jansport, that do not align with their long-term ambitions, to raise cash and pay down debt. VF Corp has 13 brands, and there may be other brands which will be sold.

## Recent Positive Developments

* Activist investors, such as Engaged Capital and Legion Partners Asset Management, own a significant stake in VF Corp, indicating their confidence in the turnaround potential.
* VF Corp reaffirmed its free cash flow guidance of $600 million, which is HUGE NEWS for a company in the midst of a turnaround. You need the Free Cash Flow to make due your payments.
* VF Corp recently collaborated with Dubai's GMG to open 200 more stores across Southeast Asia, North Africa, the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the next 5 years, does this look like a company with deteriorating sales or a company ready to enter growth mode ?
* In their most recent quarter, the company has worked down inventories and significantly improved their cash conversion cycle, achieving positive changes in accounts receivable.

## Comparative Valuation Analysis

The North Face (TNF) brand, which is one of VFC's brands, alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue annually and is still continuing to grow.  


In comparison, Crocs, a footwear company with only two brands, generates $3.9 billion in revenue and has a market capitalization of $7.5 billion.  


VF Corp, with 13 brands, of which The North Face alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue, is trading at a market capitalization of only $4.7 billion. How is this $2.8 billion difference justified ?

Here's a DCF Model assuming first year 4% growth from this low base and 0% growth onwards of VFC's net income in perpetuity. This gives a share price of $21.00.

Also assuming they return and maintain earnings at 1 billion and sticking an average 15x P/E would value them at a 15 billion market cap. Which is a 3x upside from here 

I'm looking to continue adding to this stock for the coming years. My fair value estimate assuming  3% growth and a 3% discount rate as rates fall, is $62, but  I do believe the company has what it takes to return to growth mode with new product lines like how New Balance and Abercome $ANF did. In that likely scenario, price target is &gt;$100, but it's too far down the line to know as of now.

51,wallstreetbets,Donald Trump is taking his $ of DJT - today's resale registration is our ~30 day warning,"\*\*Background\*\*

I was looking into resale registrations, one of which was contained in this mornings DJT S-1 filling where they diluted the stock 15%, here: [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124019745/ny20026576x1\_s1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124019745/ny20026576x1_s1.htm)

Why would one file a resale registration? Well, on Truth Social they are eagerly sharing a quote from the Reuters article where a lawyer says ""it's completely normal to put that up for your stockholders.""

TS post: [https://truthsocial.com/group/dwac/posts/112276002659745170](https://truthsocial.com/group/dwac/posts/112276002659745170)

So, obviously it's not that.

\*\*Theory\*\*

Why else, then, would the company file a resale registration? It could be because DJT previously did a PIPE and now intends to sell his shares - aka a Private Investment in Public Equity. SEC explainer: [https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor25\_2006/pinedo\_tanenbaum\_pipefaq.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor25_2006/pinedo_tanenbaum_pipefaq.pdf)

But why would Donald Trump put MORE money into his failing business?

Answer: He's not, he's extracting his $$$ through the abuse of an otherwise common financial instrument.

FIRST - Trump agrees to purchase some large number of additional shares for a ludicrously low price. 

""But blackout periods for selling PIPE shares!"" &gt; at the discretion of the issuer

""But never agree to low price / it's fraud!"" &gt; price solely agreed between investor and issuer. He could even choose a variable price, like ""50% of the current value of shares.""

""But PIPE shares are legended! Rule 144!"" &gt; Only before the the resale registration becomes effective, Afterwards, sell away.

""But you'd have to say something to someone!"" &gt; They just did, and afaik the only two reporting requirements are to say what shares are up for resale and who the Shareholders are (did it).

SECOND - Wait 30 days for the resale registration to complete at the SEC, using the dilution component of the S-1 as a red herring to keep people off the scent of the real scam.

THIRD - slide all those PIPE purchased, cheap ass shares into the market all stealthy like. His other 150 million shares go to zero but (1) they only existed so he could use his control of the company to abuse PIPEs (2) zero was going to happen anyways.

\*\*Trading hypothesis\*\*

DJT falls faster than any institutional investor expects because Trump uses norms built into standard practices to supercharge his scams. Evidence: his entire presidency &amp; post-presidency and all the pathetic ""but norms"" hand waving by the political class. No exceptions made for institutional investor class, sorry.

DJT cultists catch the falling knife as usual.

\*\*Positions\*\*

$3k in Puts at price points between $25 and $5 over the next 8 months.

52,wallstreetbets,PAA - Two Ways to Play in 2024,"There are a couple of DD's out there already around PAA (""Drill Baby Drill! Possible 25 Baggers"" AND ""PAA - Why it can go high, even if oil doesn't"") and I don't disagree with their logic of call leaps for '25 and '26. I bought $20C 8/16 and made a quick 330% profit, but the more I looked into midstream companies in 2024 I believe most are going to take a bit of hit in Q1 and Q2 before they start to climb. I think PAA could possibly be at $20 by the end of year, however based on several data sets and industry articles that I'm looking at I believe it's going to dip before it climbs in Q3 and Q4. That's why I think there are two ways this should be played. My current positions are listed at the end of this thread.

Midstream companies benefit when production is high. They have contracts in place with upstream companies, but these contracts are tiered based on production so to an extent these contracts protect them when production is down, BUT they do much better when production goes up based on the tiered structure of the contract. Based on Frac Spread and Rig Count (see below) I have some concerns around production and how that will impact midstream companies in Q1 and perhaps Q2. 

**Frac Spread**

What is it? Measures the number of crews actively performing hydraulic fracturing of shale in the US. It's a leading indicator of oil production. Midstream companies, like PAA, thrive when production is high.There was an increase in fracture spread in February, but my concern is looking at Total Frac Spreads (Year/Year), 2024 compared to same time 2023. The decrease in Frac Spread in January and March of this year compared to last year is of concern and for the first two weeks of April this year. Production is way down compared to this time of year. Same with Rig Counts (see below) Frac spread decreased by 227 compared to prior year, same quarter and decreased by 153 compared to Q4 2023.  

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nzczrcdv1ouc1.png?width=941&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5dc206826bda2ea0e001b9281b211dda5a2093dc

**Rig Count** 

What is it? Weekly number of drilling rigs exploring for or developing oil or gas in the US and Canada. Again, just like Frac Spread, there is a large variance of total rigs in 2023 compared to 2024. 

https://preview.redd.it/yqwfn8vw1ouc1.png?width=932&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33519546acc2b3fb95dd24b44a8c0f3101b09b42

[https://www.aogr.com/web-exclusives/us-frac-spread-count/2024](https://www.aogr.com/web-exclusives/us-frac-spread-count/2024)

Oil Prices Although oil prices are starting to climb in Q2, they were relatively low in Q1. Midstream oil companies typically do well when oil prices are high. 

https://preview.redd.it/12vr3cky1ouc1.png?width=1081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b90b053824d847e62fab1a25808a378eda3fcd6

Again, I do believe that PAA could see $20 at the end of the year, but I think Q1 results are going to meh and potentially Q2. Keep an eye on frac spread, rig count, and oil prices. If all three start to increase then PAA will have a good year, but I'm skeptical on it until I see all three of those heading in a positive direction. AND I do believe all of those indicators (frac spread, rig count, and oil prices) will trend in a way that will benefit PAA stock price. I'm just not there yet.  I closed my shares a few weeks ago and I'm in on puts and then calls and shares it is when I start to see these numbers heading in the right direction. Leaps are still cheap but I'm waiting to see how much this goes down before buying calls to determine a strike price.  This is not financial advice. Just slightly (perhaps fully) regarded and how I think this will play out this year.

53,wallstreetbets,Why the $TSLA dam will burst at $166.50,"Don’t worry, this isn’t technical analysis (I already ate all my crayons). 

Elon got levered to his substantial tits through his Morgan Stanley bankers, borrowing against the value of his TSLA shares. Then he borrowed even more to buy Twitter, which he didn’t realize put all his wealth at stake until it was too late. So he tried to back out, but the courts said no. 

Now TSLA has declined by almost 50% from its peak, and oh yeah the Delaware court threw out his $55B pay package as unfair. So he doesn’t even have a lot of the shares he borrowed against, and the stock has tanked, and he hasn’t been able to get SpaceX public and he is fucked and all his shares will go to Morgan Stanley if the stock gets below the price on his margin loans. 

That price? $500. But it’s $165 you say! Yes, but back when you were in middle school the stock split 3 for 1. $500/3 = $166.66. 

The stock has never made it to the options close (which includes after hours) below $166.66. That’s because Elon and MS have defended it to avoid disaster. It is now below $166.66. 

Will it close below? I don’t know, but you can only defend a stock (probably by buying calls that force trading desks to buy stock to hedge, increasing your risk) for so long, and we’re one bad market day from the dam bursting.

General Dynamics looks like a fantastic investment right now, with a perfect storm of escalating conflict in the Middle East, munitions demand that has scaled up tremendously over the last year, and a record backlog.

* **General Dynamics' products, such** as the NATO-standard 155mm shells, primarily the M795, are in high demand due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. These 155mm shells can be highly explosive, precision-guided, armor-piercing, or high fragmentation, showcasing the company's versatility and ability to meet diverse military needs \[1\].
* **Exhausted Inventories and High Production Goals:** U.S. inventories of the M-777 Howitzer, which uses these shells, are depleted, with significant quantities sent to support Ukraine. The U.S. has set ambitious production targets to increase 155mm shell production from current levels to 100,000 rounds per month by the end of 2025[ ](https://www.gd-ots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/155mm-NextGen-202007.pdf)\[2\].
* **Record Financial Performance:** General Dynamics recently reported its highest quarterly and annual revenue and earnings. With a net earnings increase and a record backlog of $93.6 billion, GD's financial health is robust, signaling future solid performance[ ](https://www.gd-ots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/155mm-NextGen-202007.pdf)\[3\].
* **Continued Investment and Development:** To meet current and future demands, investments in production capacity, like the expansion in Scranton and new lines in Texas and Canada, are underway. The latest developments in ammunition technology are also expected to start full-rate production within the next five years, keeping GD at the forefront of military technology.
* **Record Backlog:** GD's backlog reached nearly $94 billion at the end of the year, marking the highest year-end total in its history. This robust backlog indicates a strong pipeline of future revenues and underpins the company's financial health \[4\].
* **Global Defense Demand:** The potential conflict between Iran and Israel has heightened the global demand for military equipment. As tensions escalate, countries seek to bolster their defense capabilities, which benefits manufacturers like General Dynamics, known for its diversified defense products \[5\].

With its strategic position in the defense sector, General Dynamics is poised for success. Their increasing production capabilities and strong financials make GD calls a clear and confident choice for investors.

55,wallstreetbets,TSLA earnings ,"I see Tesla going either way, however I’m leaning towards the bearish side. Few statistics I found to make my decision. 

1- Their car delivery numbers were disappointing only delivering 386,810 cars versus analysts expected 433,371 representing a nearly 11% decrease QoQ. Even with the new cyber trucks their deliveries still plummeted, leading to a 9% drop in price. A as growing company not sure how they pulled of this of but very bearish. 

2- Teslas new car the Cyber truck has been incredibly underperforming and users say it’s dying way faster than it should especially when carrying large loads (what it’s designed for)
Edit: saw this right after posting😂 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/E53YkLsAIE

3- We have seen a very slow EV market recently with most companies shares falling or just collapsing as a whole. Rivian and Lucid are on their way with Lucid only being held up by Saudi funding even with billions of net loss and debt. We saw Fisker declare bankruptcy. While Tesla is still leading this sector, EV is down 37% in the last year. This leads into my next point…

4- With the slow EV sector and many companies collapsing we still see a handful of companies going up and competing with Tesla. Such as Xiaomi which created a new car (comparative to teslas model 3) costing only 29,900 (nearly 10,000 less than the model 3). While Tesla reported poor sales, we saw BYD sell 300,000 cars in march versus 122,230 in January AND February. Li Auto delivered 4,400 more vehicles than its 76,000 Q1 estimate. Also EV companies have been changing the market. For example NIO announced a possibility to trade in gas cars for EV. BYD has been slashing prices and growing overseas sales. XPeng has doubled incentives on its SUV. And more. So with all these companies, succeeding why is Tesla lagging?

Now of course Tesla is not totally terrible. They have been pretty innovative recently too. 
 
1- They just announced the robo taxis coming in August of 24 which would open up a whole new branch for Tesla and increase profits (if it works). This isn’t all the new tech they are unveiling. They have released the cyber truck and semi truck along with having the model 3 be around 10,000$ cheaper than an average new car right now. These tech advancements are proving valuable for Tesla. 

2- I think this is the biggest bullish flag for Tesla. Their near monopoly on self driving and the tech that comes with it. I rememberer driving in one a few years ago and its auto pilot could only do highways. I drove in one the other day and it could do anything. Switched lanes at a light because it was 1 car faster. They are the main company when it comes to self driving and this is due to the 22.5 billion miles Tesla cars have driven. Every one of the miles is mapped out by Tesla to train its self driving. Other companies may and have tried to replicate this self driving, and while it may be easy to make it, the training is very difficult. Tesla has this training, however somewhat lacks in the tech industry compared to companies like Nvidia. Nvidia has a self driving sector however they and all other self driving companies need Tesla. For a complete self driving AI you need 3 things: hardware, software, and data. Nvidia has the hardware, Nvidia and Tesla have software, however only Tesla has the data. This shows their monopoly on the data portion and currently domination of self driving. I expect it to stay this way for a while and if they decide to partner up with say Nvidia, it’s even more bullish. 

3- One more factor I think could go either way is Tesla layoffs. They just announced potential layoffs of 20% of the workforce and we saw when Meta and Google did this shareholders loved it. However if they want to make their robo taxis they need more workers. On the other hand, might replace workers with robots. Kidding but I think this could be bearish or bullish. 

In conclusion I think Tesla is bearish for earnings due to deliveries and other EV companies still making it work in the poor markets while Tesla is not. However on the long term I see Tesla going back up to where it used to be as it dominates the self driving sector. What do you guys think?🤔 

This is NOT financial advice but position are 4/26 150$ put and 8/16 75$ put for robo taxis most likely being delayed. Longterm just have shares. ",0.71,33,0,33,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'DD'}]"

South Africa recalls J&amp;J's cough syrup sold in six African nations after suspected toxicity
Reuters 2024-04-13T14:47:00-04:00
April 13 (Reuters) - South Africa's health regulator said on Saturday it is recalling batches of Johnson &amp; Johnson's (JNJ.NaE) children's cough syrup after detection of high levels of diethylene glycol.

The affected batches were sold in South Africa, Eswatini, Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania and Nigeria, the statement added.

The recall follows a report by the regulator's Nigerian counterpart on Wednesday, which first detected the toxin in a batch of Benylin Paediatric Syrup.

Kenya and Nigeria have already issued recalls for the same syrup, which is used in the treatment of hay fever and other allergic conditions affecting the upper respiratory tract.

Kenvue (KVUE.NaE), which now owns the Benylin brand after a spin-off from J&amp;J last year, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

High levels of diethylene glycol in cough syrup has been linked to the deaths of dozens of children in Gambia, Uzbekistan and Cameroon since 2022 in one of the world's worst waves of poisoning from oral medication. (Reporting by Utkarsh Shetti in Bengaluru Editing by Nick Zieminski)

57,wallstreetbets,Potential Estimated Economic Impact (Oil and VIX) of War 🇮🇷 🇮🇱,"*TL;DR: Just look at the image with the three scenarios.*

&amp;#x200B;

The fray between Israel and Iran has ruffled the feathers of traders and tycoons alike.  
You should remember that oil was already prancing around $90 a barrel due to snug supply-demand antics, and some expect this latest act of hostility has tossed a hefty log onto the fire.

Iran's bold strike—a direct jab for once, rather than through the shadowy limbs of proxies—has marked a new chapter in this age-old drama.

This escalation could send oil prices leaping out of their boots when trading resumes in New York later today (18:00 ET).

Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst at UBS Group AG:

&gt;Oil prices might spike at the opening, as this is the first time Iran struck Israel from its territory. **How long any bounce will last will also depend on the Israeli response.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ndrxwilkeiuc1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa8c035308e26a7dbc9f2b5e23b2b034ed22cbc7

&amp;#x200B;

The market, already skittish, now has more to chew on, especially with **threats looming over the vital Strait of Hormuz, where a fifth of the world's oil flows** as if through the eye of a needle.

Prices, which already include a risk premium of about $10 a barrel, are poised to push higher, warned Iman Nasseri, the Middle East managing director at consultancy FGE.

&gt;Prices could add another $2 to $5 a barrel due to **concern of further Israeli reprisals or Iranian interference with shipping around the Persian Gulf**.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems the oil markets are braced for a bumpy ride. As tensions simmer, and with OPEC+ keeping a tight lid on production, this latest episode might strain global stockpiles even further.

According to Rosalind Mathieson, a Bloomberg News Director:

&gt;As with other market assets, **the outlook for oil seems to hinge on any Israeli response to the Iranian attack.** Trading resumes at 6pm New York time on Sunday. The risk of a direct Iranian attack on Israel was already at least partly priced in — benchmark Brent crude, up 17% this year, passed $90 a barrel after the strike on Iran’s diplomatic compound in Syria.

Here's what the smart cats at Bloomberg estimated could happen.  
I should point out that at this point in time, we might be moving into the purple band.

&amp;#x200B;

[from Bloomberg Economics](https://preview.redd.it/nvvreyf3diuc1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29db1a212dc1e8db614a250d492429cc765f5252)

&amp;#x200B;

On Wednesday, we'll get the weekly crude oil inventories (prior +5.84 mln) at 10:30 ET.  
It won't move the markets, but people will pay more attention.

As for the closing numbers from Friday:

CL00-USA Crude Oil futures: $0.58 higher (+0.7%) at $85.58/barrel.  
NG00-USA Nat Gas: (0.0%) at $1.77/MMBtu.  
RB00-USA RBOB Gasoline: $0.02 higher (+0.7%) at $2.80/gallon.  
HO00-USA Heating oil futures: $0.03 higher (+1.1%) at $2.69/gallon.

&amp;#x200B;

I won't delve into what each country should or should not do.  
I can only control what I do.

If Israel's response adds a log to the fire, I'm building my watchlist for those sectors that are bound to get panicky sellers—those who rely on oil prices.

So far, I'm planning to short **IBIT**, but I will wait to see either a weak open or confirmation regarding Israel's response. Assuming she gaps down, I'll wait to avoid an expected initial bounce.

That's the iShares Bitcoin Trust.  
My thesis is that those investors who trust Bitcoin will invest directly in Bitcoin.  
Those who are dwindling their feet in that water through an ETF are bound to get jittery.  
And also, it might get more expensive for Bitcoin miners to operate, I assume.

I will wait to see if **LUV** convincingly breaks her support at around $27.  
If she does and other airlines follow along, I might even go with **FLYD**, instead. That's the MicroSectors Travel 3x Inverse Leveraged ETN.

And I will keep my eyes on **OILD** (MicroSectors Oil &amp; Gas Exploration &amp; Production 3x Inverse Leveraged ETN) and **OILU** (MicroSectors Oil &amp; Gas Exploration &amp; Production 3x ETN).  
Unless the direct conflict turns into war (instead of calculated act-and-wait), I will just play shares and not options since I'm not willing to pay for volatility or not reacting as fast.

&amp;#x200B;

As a short-term swing trader, I'll mostly avoid any overnight positions.  
There are bound to be some big trend-follower players that might offload, so I'll keep an eye out on which sector they run out first. I'll do this by keeping an eye out on all the SPDR ETFs. Well, the top and bottom parts of that list.

&amp;#x200B;

Have a good day.

P.S. I'm certainly not hoping for war. But war—or the potential of war—can move markets, and as a trader, I play what the market shows me.",0.72,29,0,29,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'DD'}]"
58,wallstreetbets,ALCC/OKLO DD,"I started looking into ALCC and Oklo this week after noticing the huge pump and dump this past week, and just thought I'd share some DD with you all.

Assuming that the merger closes without any ALCC public stockholders exercising the \~$10/share redemption right, the equity structure will probably look like this (from the amended S-4):

https://preview.redd.it/phe5mi8p4auc1.png?width=1256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5042d7131d540a850446c8b608dbc5c2d4b997f3

And post-merger, the combined financials will probably be similar to this:

https://preview.redd.it/amru6bau4auc1.png?width=1186&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3993c76bfdabdfd3b7cbbb35a6661bc305b0cc14

Right now, pre-merger ALCC public stockholders' main asset is a \~$300M trust for potential redemptions ($10.41/share redemption price as of 12/31/2023).  Based on the equity structure above, after the merger and some dilutive options, ALCC public stockholders will only have a 17.6% share of the total $311 million in assets.  So what do ALCC stockholders get in return?  A piece of Oklo's future business... so what does that look like?

I don't know, and I'm not a finance person or someone in the energy industry, but i pretended to be and made a spreadsheet.  Also, I know stocks don't trade on fundamentals, but thought it might be helpful to think about it this way.



https://preview.redd.it/2a57btp48auc1.png?width=1087&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa8a9c4b0a5bcbf1d4ab7d65ea556c7c4c460e50

NRC regulatory approval is the huge threshold question.  If Oklo gets approval, and their product is for real, this company could be huge.  If NRC says nope, then the investment probably goes to zero.

In the ""bet analysis"" part below, I calculated an Expected Value based on 25% odds of regulatory approval using a discounted cash flow method.  You'll see that this model assumes that Oklo becomes as big as CEG in about 20 years.

Lots of IFs for this stock, but I ended up buying 1,000 shares at $12.85 on Friday because I think that Biden or Trump will continue pushing nuclear energy, and eventually, Oklo will get its NRC approval.  Planning on buying another 1,000 if it gets close to $11 before the merger.  And then I'll just keep my fingers crossed that Oklo is for realo.

**EDIT/UPDATE:**

- ALCC's financial advisor (Ocean Tomo) did a discounted cash flow analysis of the merger.  Interesting read, and it goes into their financial model analysis of the deal (search for ""Aurora 15we Illustrative Unit Economics"" and start reading from there):

- ALCC/sponsor shares are subject to various lockup periods subject to the stock price trading above $12/14/16 for 20 out of 60 consecutive trading days.  Oklo insider-owned shares are subject to lockup for 180 days past closing of the merger.

- SEC's new SPAC rules become effective July 1, 2024, so I'm thinking that the merger will happen in June so that ALCC doesn't become subject to the new disclosure requirements.

59,wallstreetbets,Intel DD - Underbought and Oversold: Why You Should Be Investing In The AI Revolution's Cheapest Stock,"It's 2024 and Intel has not exactly performed admirably. While its competitors - AMD and NVIDA - have hit the moon and then some, Intel is still struggling along at around the price that it was prior to anyone knowing what ChatGPT was. If anyone had the massive foresight to invest in a chipmaker on the eve of the explosion in AI hype, they'd have been wrong to choose Intel. Problematic!

There are reasons for this, of course. Intel has not come out with a cutting-edge product - Nvidia's H100 has blown anything Intel's been able to offer out of the water. Intel has a notoriously dysfunctional corporate structure. Intel has been, since way before this subreddit existed, known for being a limp stock that trading sideways. China has been making noises about phasing out foreign chips. All these factors have prevented Intel from achieving the sort of green candlesticks that AMD and Nvidia sprouted as the implications of AI - and the vital role GPUs would play in powering it - became clear.

In spite of all this, I think Intel is a strong buy right now. Why?

For one, it's at a price we haven't seen in nearly a year. There's been a string of bad - but not structurally undermining - news coming out about the company recently, similar in form to the Gemini debacle that brought Google down to 133 a month ago. Google is now at 160, because AI is a hell of a thing to have in your column. The same dynamic is going to push Intel's price up. If you want that in technical analytic terms - RSI is below 30. Buy.

Intel is also catching up. [It's releasing a chip](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intels-artificial-intelligence-ai-chip-085500073.html) that can beat the H100! That's not the whole story, of course - there's rumors that NVDA's latest Blackwell offering will be better than Intel's when they release it later this year. But demand for AI and the chips that power it is only spiking. We're even starting to see LLMs that can operate locally at the consumer level, which requires a lot of hardware. Nvidia's already selling out for years in advance - people aren't going to be able to get their hands on the most cutting-edge chips for a long, long time. And so Intel is going to end up with a shitload of demand in its lap. 

There's also the national security angle. Intel is the only major domestic chipmaker, and America has a considerable interest in ensuring that its domestic chipmaking capabilities are at least on par with other countries. Congress has already passed billions of dollars to domestic chipmaking efforts, and Intel will be a major beneficiary as it continues to dispense cash. 

Their earnings call is on 4/25, and so [here's my 4/26 call spread](https://imgur.com/a/kNWdyfT). I expect these to pick up a lot of IV as we get closer to 4/25. We're going to make a lot of money together, regards.",0.84,648,0,648,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'DD'}]"
60,wallstreetbets,GoPro is ridiculously cheap fundamentally. ,"I think stock is should  atleast trade at 2-3x the current price.  Market cap is just 200 mil ? 

They have bought at least 40 mil in stocks in 2023. Are you kidding me?

Fundamental thesis: 
- Strategic Shift and Innovation: GoPro has evolved its business model from selling just hardware to combining hardware sales with subscription services and premium services launched in February 2024. This shift towards a more service-oriented model aims to provide a steady revenue stream and enhance customer loyalty.

- Financial Performance: GoPro has shown significant cash generation improvements over the years. For example, from an average cash usage of $46 million in the years before 2020, to generating $91 million and $221 million in subsequent years, although there was a slight dip to $2 million in cash generation in 2023. Despite this, GoPro managed to partially repay its convertible debt and repurchase $40 million in stock in 2023.

- Market Presence: GoPro has maintained its position as a leading brand in the U.S. camcorder market, with the HERO12 BLACK being the best-selling camera. The company boasts a strong social media presence with millions of followers and billions of lifetime views on its YouTube channel, indicating a robust market reach and brand recognition.

- Recent Acquisition: GoPro's acquisition of Forcite, aimed at enhancing the performance and safety of helmets, starting with motorcycle helmets, signals GoPro's intention to expand its market presence into new segments, leveraging its brand strength in motorsports and among motorcycle enthusiasts.

- Subscription Services Growth: The company has seen growth in its subscription services, with a notable increase in the average selling price (ASP) of its cameras and a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 69% for its subscription services. The subscriber renewal rates show increasing loyalty, with more than 80% renewal rate by the third year.

- Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): GoPro highlighted its commitment to CSR with initiatives like employee engagement, diversity, and sustainability goals. The company aims to source 100% renewable energy for its U.S. locations by 2026 and has disclosed its greenhouse gas emissions.

- Financial Highlights:  Revenue showed a slight decline in 2023 compared to previous years, but the adjusted EBITDA remained positive, indicating a healthy operational profit margin. There's also a notable shift in the MSRP camera revenue mix, with a higher percentage of cameras being sold at prices above $400 MSRP in 2023 compared to 2019.

Analyzing these points, GoPro's strategic focus on diversification through subscription services, its strong brand presence, and recent initiatives to penetrate new markets suggest a solid foundation for growth. While there was a dip in cash generation in 2023, GoPro's ability to maintain profitability and invest in strategic acquisitions and stock repurchases demonstrates financial resilience. Given this context, a market cap of $200 million might seem conservative, especially when considering the company's assets, equity, and strategic positioning for future growth. The information suggests that GoPro is actively working to expand and solidify its market presence, which could potentially increase its valuation in the eyes of investors looking beyond the immediate financial figures to the company's growth potential and strategic initiatives.",0.51,2,0,2,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'DD'}]"
61,wallstreetbets,🚀🌕 SOFI: The Sleeper About to Blast Off! 🌕🚀,"Listen up, degenerates and fellow regards of WallStreetBets, it’s time to tune into a stock that’s been flying under the radar but is primed to make some seismic waves. I’m talking about none other than SOFI Technologies, Inc. (Ticker: $SOFI). Here’s why your portfolio needs this rocket fuel, especially with their earnings announcement on April 29th that’s expected to be a monumental blowout, continuing their streak of outperformance.

**🔥 The Lowdown on $SOF**I:

**- Mid-Cap Maverick with Mega Growth:** Clocking in with a market cap of $7.38B and trading at a savory $7.56 a share, SoFi ain’t no small fry. With 959 million shares out there, this company’s financial growth spurt is just getting started. Revenue shot up 300% from $560M to a whopping $2 billion! If that doesn’t scream growth, I don’t know what does. Did I mention they’re forecasting upwards of $.80 EPS in 2026? 🤯

**- Financials on Fire:** Despite Wallstreet neglecting SoFi’s positive free cash flow and positive GAAP earnings in Q4 and going forward, this beast is about evolution. With lending, financial services and a proprietary technology platform driving a revenue rocket, this puppy is set to print some serious tendies for those with the cajones to hold. Especially when that revenue is launching faster than a SpaceX test flight.

**- Industry Underdog Ready to Lead the Pack:** In a sea of 56 companies, SoFi stands out with its beyond-undervalued metrics - Price to Book, PEG, P/E, etc. despite its high growth trajectory. And let’s not forget, while banks spend billions on dying brick-and-mortar locations, SOFI’s lean model means more fuel for the growth rocket without the dead weight.

**- Membership and Product Growth Off the Charts:** SoFi achieved strong year-over-year growth in both members and products in the fourth quarter and full-year 2023. New member additions of nearly 585,000 in the quarter brought total members to over 7.5 million by year end, up over 2.3 million, or 44%, from the prior year end. With product usage booming and new members flocking, it’s like every quarter is Black Friday but without the discount because SOFI doesn’t need to cut prices to attract the crowd. Did I mention they’re now the official bank sponsor of the NBA? Hmm…I’d bet my wife’s boyfriend’s car that we hit record new members this quarter.

**- Earnings Explosion Incoming:** Mark your calendars for April 29th because SOFI’s about to drop their earnings like a mic at a rap battle. Year after year, they’ve been knocking expectations out of the park, and this year’s going to be no exception. Get ready for a blowout that’ll have Wall Street's jaws on the floor.

**🌟 Why $SOFI is Your Ticket to the Moo**n 🌟

**- Blowout Earnings Anticipated:** The word on the street (and by street, I mean the data-driven corridors of finance nerds) is that SOFI is about to blow the roof off with their upcoming earnings. They’ve been beating expectations like it’s their job (well, it kinda is), and April 29th is going to be a show you don’t want to miss.

**- Rapid Growth in a Booming Sector:** Financial tech isn’t just the future; it’s the now. SOFI, with its digital-first approach, is poised to dominate. Membership growth, product expansion, and strategic acquisitions like Galileo signal a company on the move, not content with playing second fiddle. It’s a matter of time before their tech platform takes off. They have a deep pipeline and have a top 5 US bank \*\*cough\*\* CITI Bank \*\*cough\*\* going through a proof of concept. They’re being overly conservative with their 20-25% annual tech revenue growth.

**- Valuation Vindication on the Horizon:** This is like paying $.30 for $1. Bargain hunting baby.

**🔮 Conclusion: Don’t Sleep on SOF**I 🔮

In the world of stocks, SOFI is that hidden gem, glittering in the rough, waiting for the discerning eye to recognize its inherent value. With explosive growth, industry-leading metrics, and an earnings report poised to shatter ceilings, SOFI isn’t just a good investment; it’s a portfolio cornerstone for those looking to ride the next wave of financial innovation.

So, strap in, fellow WallStreetBets warriors. It’s time to add some SOFI to your stock arsenal and prepare for lift-off. The countdown has begun, and April 29th is just the beginning. To the moon, SOFI! 🚀🌕

Each craft will cost around 50 mil and the initial fleet will consist of 5 crafts, 4 operational and 1 backup. They plan to put this craft to work running between 300 - 400 flights per year and generating an annual revenue of around $1.3 billion with a gross profit of $800 - $900 mil.

The FTC also wants undo the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, claiming Meta illegally maintains a monopoly in “personal social networking”. If these go through it will be a massive blow to the bottom line. Twitter is also suing Meta claiming Threads copied their business and trade secret theft, we'll see how this plays out. Lets also mention the never ending regulatory fines and litigation with European agencies.  All these issues are a serious liability for the company.

The competition- The single biggest threat to Meta is TikTok. The reason they are lobbying so hard to get it banned. People migrate to the next big thing, older generations dont like change so i fully expect them to stay with Facebook until the end but the smart money saw whats happening with TikTok, how fast its taken over the younger generation and they want it, all of it. Steven Mnuchin is a smart man, he knows at the current rate of TikToks growth its going to overtake Facebook and Instagram within the next 2-3 years. Its in a hyper growth stage and Meta has simply stalled out.

TikTok is also launching a direct competitor to Instagram and WhatsApp, very soon. Those users 35 and under  currently on Insta will easily migrate over to the newest thing. There is no loyalty to a service or app. If you are spending most of your time already watching tiktok, you can easily switch over to Notes, no need to go back to Instagram if all your friend are posting videos,pictures and chatting on TikTok. More time spent on Tiktok, less time on Meta apps.

The presidential election- The Presidential ad spending is always massive and grows each year but its very limited. Only 28.1 percent goes to digital marketing, most goes toward tv ads not small facebook, google and newspaper ads.

AI - Meta announced their AI plans even making their own chips, or designing their own chips. This seems like a last ditch effort to stay relevant and a costly venture like the metaverse. I don't see what meta could do with AI other than mine peoples data more efficiently and sell it. Picture and video AI is limited, there's so many third party apps that can do it better. 

Meta is running out of ideas, the company has peaked, we may start to see declining revenue and user activity year after year. The balance of influence is shifting. Meta had its run, time to join Myspace. 

lastly the dividend, another effort to keep investors around. You can get a higher yield and take less risk holding a treasury bond. ",0.4,0,0,0,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'DD'}]"

Wanna make ez money? Well TSMC’s earnings report on the 18th is gonna be a very noice 8-15% jump on their stock price. I was waiting to put this out until after April 10th because of the Monthly Earnings which might have been impacted by the earthquake, but all is still good according to them so here we go.

 

\-----Revenue-----

1st quarter revenue is crazy good.

January up 7.9%        Y-o-Y

February up 11.3%   Y-o-Y

March up 34.3%        Y-o-Y

March 2023 was pretty bad last year, but she stepped up big time this year with some very nice Y-o-Y gains.

https://preview.redd.it/wz2ovevnvptc1.jpg?width=679&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd3870d6e46d62acadea97671aae62ff8afcd370

In the March 2024 Revenue Report listed above, January to March revenue is up 16.5% Y-o-Y, very good  Y-o-Y gain for a company of TSMC’s size.

It gets better though. 

Looking at 1Q24 guidance from the Q423 earnings report, revenue was estimated to be between 18 - 18.8 billion dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x3puidx2wptc1.jpg?width=1182&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65cd7f1d7db65312681663f9b1048bfa12431280

Using the above guidance and converting  NT$ to US$ we get about 18.4 billion dollars for January to March revenue for 2024, pretty much right in line with the guidance. I don't have all the info on other more boring stuff, but from what I see, we are pretty solid right now for the revenue numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

\-----EPS-----

 

Is TSMC going to beat the expected/forecasted EPS ?

Absolutely.

If we look at the numbers from last years expected Q1 2023 eps of 1.21, it was beat with an actual EPS of 1.3, and that's with a pretty bad march 2023. And if you remember, this March we have a 34% increase Y-o-Y AND a 7.5% M-o-M increase from February. It's looking very good so far.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The forecasted EPS is around 1.29 - 1.3 right now.

In Q1 2023 the EPS estimate was beat by around 8.2%

With a 16.5% Y-o-Y increase in revenue for January to March,and only a 6.6% increase in estimated EPS Im guesstimating a surprise EPS of around 1.4 - 1.45,  beating estimates by 8.5 - 12%.

&amp;#x200B;

 \-----STONK PRICE-----

How much of a jump am I thinking in the stock price?

Over 10%

Recently Q4 of 2023 had a surprise EPS beat of 5.11% and the stock price jumped from around $100 to $110 over the course of a day. With a better EPS surprise I think we can rally around 8-15% over a day or 2 with the ai hype train going on and the expected 20% growth for TSMC estimated this year by themselves.

Below are my positions, mostly ITM calls that have gone up over the past 2 weeks:

decent profit, 170 if you are feeling ballzy

65,wallstreetbets,Pools Closed: Why LESL is Circling the Drain,"What was your first thought when you read Joann Fabrics went bankrupt?  If you're like me, it was: ""Holy shit, I can't believe they weren't bankrupt 10 years ago.""  I started looking for similarly situated companies that the market hasn't finished off yet and it lead me to Leslie Inc.

There are a lot of parallels between LESL and Joanne:  Both are primarily legacy brick and mortar stores, serving an aging clientele, and both are (or were) extremely vulnerable to ecommerce and shifting consumer trends.  I could justify shorting the absolute shit out of LESL on its fundamentals alone.  Negative equity, bad loan terms, and no line of sight to enough profitability to get out from under it.  They're not even a realistic acquisition target due to their bylaws.  All of that is readily apparent in their annual report if you care to read it:  https://ir.lesliespool.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001193125-24-014254/0001193125-24-014254.pdf

Speaking of their annual report: They lay a lot of blame for their poor performance on inclement weather.  It's literally been the hottest year in history and they sell pool stuff.  Not buying it.

LESL went public in 2020 and, other than the initial honeymoon period, it's been a sustained loser since.  Their IPO made some funds a lot of money, but certainly didn't make them a better company.  Now, with no relief from high interest rates and debt covenants that could restrain them from raising new money, LESL is more vulnerable than ever.  

The vast majority of their existing equity is tied up in their inventories.  Not unusual but also not good news considering their house brands are overpriced and alternatives in the market place abound.  Based on my visits to a few of their stores, it seems like they're sustained mostly by: 1) boomers who haven't heard of youtube and cannot figure out how a pool works; and 2) literally nobody else. I defy you to find a house brand they sell that is price competitive with the market.

The next generation of pool owners isn't going to pay a 40% mark-up to buy from a chain pool place (not when amazon exists and home depot sells a similar product cheaper).  Ecommerce is coming for them in a big way and LESL's enormous geographic footprint will end up being an albatross around its neck.  They have 46 stores alone in the tropical paradise of Pennsylvania.  Good luck paying all that rent.

The best time to short LESL was three years ago, the second best time is now.  It's not HTB and short interest is relatively low considering how weak it is.  I am betting they're going to halve before the end of the year, more if more people pay attention to it.

I think it took a real rise because of the [WSJ article](https://archive.ph/A5WHE) back at the end of March about VST being an AI stock and this thing looks more like NVDA every day. I call it my poor man's NVDA. Maybe my fellow smooth brains might see it too? This Texas based integrated retail electricity and power generation company is just on a tear this year. It has a focus on low and no carbon emission generation. They are pushing the boundaries towards a sustainable future; not just doubling down on fossil fuels while green washing with a dabbling in renewables. Even though this has increased from $38 to $70 as of this writing, I still think it's a sleeper hit in your investment portfolio, especially with the AI boom printing money. AI data centers need energy like they need NVDA chips. All part of the shovels to gold miners metaphor.

**Risks and Considerations:** Undeniable growth doesn't mean undeniable rise in stock price. This is not financial advice and I have a bias to make this more popular. 

**Technical Analysis:** For what it's worth, the basic technicals are showing a slight pause and reversal to the 50 day SMA but still quite a bit above it. It's currently right in the middle of a Keltner channel but not below it enough to use the scalping tactic. So for any day trading or swing trading approach, I'd say just watch it for a better opening. Since this acts more like NVDA, then maybe waiting to jump in is just going to make it more expensive for you. 

**Conclusion:** Vistra Corp (VST) presents a compelling investment opportunity, especially for those looking to leverage the burgeoning demand for electricity driven by the AI boom. With solid financials, strategic growth initiatives, and a strong foothold in clean energy, Vistra is not just navigating the transition to a zero-carbon future; it's leading the charge. As the energy sector becomes increasingly critical in the AI era, Vistra's unique position could make it a standout choice for investors seeking growth and sustainability.

Vistra offers a blend of innovation, sustainability, and financial savvy that could pay dividends in the AI-driven future.

I am long on 165 contracts @ $1 for 4/19 exp $75 calls which has a realistic possibility of the underlying going to $80 by expiration and being worth $66K profit.

67,wallstreetbets,"$GES- DD, From underappreciated to Worthy Purchase ","As someone had posted on the subject of Guess, I started to get interested in the company myself. In looking at the financials of GUESS and the current market opinion, I have strong confidence in the stock being a worthy purchase.

Financial Information:

Recently they had announced their earnings in which they had beat expectations. With an expected of 1.56 EPS vs a reported 2.01 EPS, and 856.64M expected revenue vs 891.05M reported revenue. This resulted in the stock popping up 20% from $25 to around $31.

Why Purchase Now?

Even though the significant gains from their earnings has already been shown, the company now plans on making their investors happy. The CEO announced a special dividend of $2.25 per share and a $200 million [share buy back](https://investors.guess.com/news-releases/news-release-details/guess-inc-board-authorizes-new-200-million-share-repurchase). You might say, ""Cool, there is a special dividend, why should I care"", well you should care because of how the market is currently treating the overall company. According to [Marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ges?mod=mw_quote_tab) 26.39% of the public float is shorted, compare this to other companies like NVIDIA with only 1.26% shorted, or LULU which only has 3.15% shorted whilst having bad earnings, bad outlook, and being a clothing brand. This implies that the CEO intends for this to be a short squeeze. They are buying their shares back, making shorters lose money, making them in turn buy to cover their positions, and then driving up the stock. On top of that, owning the stock won't just have a chance for a dramatic increase, but the special dividend will pay any shareholder hansomely for owning before April 17th.

Conclusion:

Even though there are some doubts around this clothing brand, the postition it is taking against those that are looking at the company's downfall is aggresive and interesting. Comparing GUESS to other clothing brands, this is the one to buy, even if it is just for the special dividend. I hope you guys like my opinion, and Id love to hear what others think.

68,wallstreetbets,"PAA - Why it can go higher, even if oil doesnt","This is a long term play (at least through the summer and into US elections).  If you are trying to trade every few days at the bid/ask with more than a handful of contracts, you are leaving a bunch on the table and getting screwed by the spread.  PAA gets paid based on oil volume (NGL is hedged) so the play here is the econ forecasts were low, oil demand forecasts were low, other factors will limit supply, and  options buying requires some hedging on what is a normally low vol options stock.

I was originally inspired by the DD in “Drill Baby Drill” to look into PAA.  While I thought his reasoning of “why” the options were cheap was off a bit (its a divi company, that's partly why they are so cheap) - upon further looking into it I agreed based on the following and jumped on 3/28 in the afternoon with more purchases subsequently.  This was originally started last week but did not get out until Monday after close due to some family items.  (Originally I said I would be happy with $19 by end of April and ecstatic with $19.5 as this is a slow bleed up play)

I have \~2.500 contracts of varying strikes through 2026.  I will not look to exit until around elections or end of year **by exercising** (not selling as MMs are low balling bids).

I will attach some screenshots of PAA Q1 2024 investor presentation from:

In general, the thoughts are this:

**PAA Business**

**Location of Pipelines** - good locations for non sanctioned oil demand (US and Canada)

**Crude &amp; NGL** - NGL is 90% hedged.  Most crude in the US is from the Permian, where their pipelines are. 85% of their EBITDA is tied to crude. OECD inventories are at multi year lows.

**Volume play** - demand is going to increase more than anticipated, leading to substantial more volume in their pipelines (economies are better than anticipated, oil is higher than thought, location location location, etc)

**PAA earnings assumptions** - PAA assumed $75 average cost of oil per barrel (Q1 investor presentation) for earnings, which we crossed mid march, we are going to get better forward guidance.  See price of PAA since mid march as well.

**PAA Permian Pricing Contracts -** PAA have not updated their pricing for Permian since October or earlier last year, maybe with higher oil we get higher fees they can charge on trunking/gathering further boosting earnings.

**Dividend -**  Most traditional buyers of Oil/Gas are dividend guys. (Yes technically this is RoC) They are happy with 7% a year.  PAA diverged from ET/EPD etc a \~+7% since 3/28 when we all bought options. These divi guys might jump ship to PAA leading to more demand for stock and driving up prices.

**“Undervalued” -**  Well the concept of undervalued always rubbed me wrong (I prefer incorrectly valued based on faulty assumptions) The market already had PAA up by \~50% over trailing 12 months prior to our 3/28 options buying.  Summer before covid it was $24+.

**PAA Army**

**Options buying -** Most options are LEAPs in 2025/2026 and there are a shit ton compared to normal.  In a nostalgic review of the history of a certain stock I was reminded it got kicked off originally with long dated calls and subsequent hedging with upward price movement.  While there will be no short squeeze (its the least shorted stock of its peers), we might be able to get some gamma action from the delta hedging as we overloaded the normal call volume by a ton.  This is also why ET/EPD etc **will not see the same price action regardless of oil surging.  Its all of the other reasons +  options buying that is the recipe for this cake.**

**Delta Hedging -** Unless we are buying covered calls from the institutions holding PAA (unlikely but is good regardless as they want the price to increase as well), the MMs will likely delta hedge the long dated call options by buying more stock.  (This is why we seem to spike and then trade in a range for the day, they sell when its too high, and buy when its too low.  It could also explain why we tend to end the day in the highest volume areas reached earlier in the day or the high from the previous day like last week).

**Macro**

**Inflation** - Biden needs lower inflation to win.  ‘Muricans are pissed.  Oil is in everything and people see the price of gas all the time. To quote J Pow - “this shit will be a bumpy road over the next few years on our way to 2%.”  Only way to decrease the price of oil when demand is hotter around the world than previously thought is to increase domestic output.  Also if Brent gets too high, we might be exporting a bunch more.   Other countries have incentives to keep the price higher (see geo political)

**Economy -** Generally speaking the economies of the world are doing better than thought.  US is growing faster than anticipated (sorry bers). China also seems to be picking up steam after some stimulus, so they can drink up the Russian oil.  This is increasing demand over what was previously forecast.

**Crude -** Most estimates I have seen have been for crude to be high 70s to low 80s for the year based on economic forecasts which are turning out to be low balled.

**Institutional/Retail Ownership -** According to Ortex, the free float is \~65%, but also &gt;50% is held by institutions.  This might lend weight to the divi guys being familiar with/owning PAA and jumping ship from others oil gas divis to PAA for divis and capital growth.

**OPEC+** Opec reaffirmed voluntary cuts into June, this will limit supply from OPEC+ (as much as that can be trusted).

**Geopolitical**

**Saudi budget -**  Fitch ratings estimated the Saudis need &gt;$90 **average for the whole year** to balance their budget. If Q4 is the same as Q1 (\~$75), that would mean an average of \~$105 for Q2 and Q3 for this to hold based on napkin math.  If Q2=Q3=Q4, thats an average price of $95.  I think the first is overly optimistic but is still higher than the $75 PAA used for guidance in Q1.

**Brazil -** lets see what happens here…

**Russia/Ukraine** - Ukraine is trying to take out Russian refineries with new drones.  Can they succeed if it could disrupt US aid in an election year?  Russia also had to put off its new nat gas facility in the arctic due to lack of arctic ships.

**Middle East** - Speculation is that Bibi wants to pick a fight with Iran to bolster his standing in the gov (he might have been ousted had the Hamas situation not happened).  Who knows if this is true, but its a wildcard.

**Election** Biden is a known commodity.  If Trump wins, I think positive perception will flow through to oil/gas domestically (regardless of whether he pumps more).  Other countries might have vested interests in high oil as a proxy economic war against the US (likewise they might not want the US oil to grow too much)

Some sources:

**PAA Business**

**Location of Pipelines**

PAA operates pipelines in the US (e.g. Permian) and Canada.  These locations are important for Macro/Geopolitical reasons, i.e. they are from the “good guys” (who has ever sanctioned the Leafs who are walking Christmas cards for example). OECD inventories are at multi year lows (and economies are doing much better than anticipated following rate hikes, China seems to be taking off after some stimulus)

**I like Aug/Nov 2024 ($20c-$25c) and Jan 2026 LEAPs ($20c to $25c).  I think 2025 is a bit crowded and I like the extra delta that the MMs would need to hedge on the 2026s.  Shorter dated calls are also an option as that could positively affect the price.**

**I plan to wait until after summer at the earliest or after the election and will exercise.  I might also hold onto 2026 well into next year if the economy is on a tear - we have 21 months, its not a 0dte.**

1000 Aug 2024 calls from $20-$22

1200 Jan 2026 calls from $20-$25

69,wallstreetbets,"Leaps on $ET, Potential 10 bagger as Oil Surges (DD)","**Leaps on $ET are dirt cheap right now.**

We have seen oil really ramping up in the past week and has gone up 10% in the past month. Tickers such as $PAA have seen big gains this week, especially the leap options that were trading at super low premiums. $PAA 1/17/25 20c was trading at $0.15 less than two weeks ago and is now trading at $1.25, an 8 bagger for those who got in at the premium. I expect to see this momentum continue as oil prices surge. 

Now, there is another potential 10 bagger waiting for its chance to shine while the oil sector becomes crowded. $ET is one of the largest and most diversified midstream energy companies in the united states, which transports oil and natural gas. It is the second biggest midstream company with a market cap of 53B. So far this year $ET has gone up 26%, and has beat earnings 3 out of the last 4 quarters. It has also increased distribution in every quarter since the start of 2022, with its quarterly distribution of 31.5 cents being higher than it was before they cut distribution back during covid. 

$ET will greatly benefit due to this increased demand in oil. The IEA raised its estimate in March for 2024 oil demand from 110,000 b/d (barrels per day) to 1.3 million b/d. Due to the Russian oil sanctions and other political issues driving oil and gas prices, the US has become the largest oil producer in the world and will continue to be. 

The premiums on $ET leaps are still super low right now. 1/17/25 20c is sitting at a pretty $0.12 per contract. 1/16/26 20c and 22c are sitting at $0.30 and $0.17 respectively. Again, just so much upside to this play. With $PAA leaps already taking off, others such as $ET &amp; $EPD will follow with this surge in oil during 2024. The upside for short term and long term profits are substantial. Also would like to thank /u/PuzzleheadedTear5969 for his DD on $PAA and inspiring me to look more into this sector. His DD has more information of the political climate sparking this surge in oil.

I'm in for 120 contracts at $0.12 for 1/17/25. Considering adding 1/26 leaps as well tomorrow.

70,wallstreetbets,Delta Airlines ($DAL) ER DD,"Hi Regards,

I will not be answering messages, but will comment here and there as my time allows. I have more DD, but I do not have the energy to post an essay. Remember, this is not financial advice, but a quick, high level DD, for the majority of people who play options based on emotion or trends, or to hedge their plays (as options were initially intended for).

I may scalp some or I may not. I may post if I do, I may not. If you can afford to hold, hold your options play post earnings. Remember, the day of **EARNINGS** is when the CPI, Inflation Rate, FOMC Minutes are announced.

My position: $48.5C

The other guy u/[GarthbrooksXV](https://www.reddit.com/user/GarthbrooksXV/) posted that DAL will 'shit the bed' based on a variety of incorrect data.

  
Here is why I believe Delta Airlines ($DAL) will go up a modest \~8% to 12% post earnings:

1. On their previous earnings, they expected a capacity increase between 3% to 5%

2. Full year 2024 EPS expected to be $6 to $7 a share

3. Most of Delta's aircrafts are NOT the Boeing 737 Max. Yes, they have ordered them, but the deliveries are delayed.

4. Those who fly Delta, are aware that this is a top airline. They are a part of the Sky Alliance Team, and most of their airline partnerships charge far more than their competitors (on average).

5. As u/[GarthbrooksXV](https://www.reddit.com/user/GarthbrooksXV/) mentioned a 'Bonus Reason.' Here is mine:

Bonus Reason: During AMEX's previous earnings call, the CFO responded to questions with the following responses regarding Delta Airlines ($DAL):

***""So, I don't -- you know, we'll see whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's a data point. But we keep seeing, you know, a lot of strength and, you know, the partnership we have with Delta is working very, very well. Originations, you know, of new cards are very strong. And, you know, cardmembers decided to redeem a bit less in Q4 with airline tickets than they did in the past.""***

***""Yeah. So, the Delta product is still going very, very strong. The total billing growth on the Delta product for the full year was up 15%, and we originating a lot of new cards as well. My comment about their, you know, softness in terms of Q4, hard to say whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's just a blip.***

***Time will tell. But it's still going very, very strong. And the engagement with the partner -- you know, with the partner is very strong. The partnership is going strong.***

***So, I don't see any softness there at all. And, you know, I will say as well that their credit quality of those new cardmembers remain very strong. I made comments about it's one of the fastest-growing segment on the loan side. and it comes with very strong performance.***

***People who travel a lot and who fly a lot tend to have strong credit quality, and we see that on the loan side, on the spend side, on the origination side. So, you know, I'm not worried about that at this stage.""***

This is nothing against the other user, I am just stating my DD since in my opinion, I believe his had a lot of incorrect information.

This is NOT financial advice.

71,wallstreetbets,Bullish on Starbucks,"We all know Starbucks, the giant coffee brand with its ubiquitous stores attracting many white girls. While a P/E ratio of 23 might seem high, I recently invested in Starbucks for reasons that go beyond just the numbers.

One key factor is the addictive nature of coffee and the fast consumption of Starbucks' products. This constant cycle keeps customers coming back for more. Additionally, the brand itself, its name recognition, and the inviting atmosphere of its stores are valuable assets that contribute significantly to future revenue streams.

Now, let's delve into the numbers. Starbucks boasts an impressive 25% Sustainable ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) and a healthy average operating margin of 15.5%. Interestingly, despite being a well-established franchise, Starbucks continues to expand at a steady pace, opening roughly 6% new stores annually. This highlights their significant growth potential.

Looking geographically, Starbucks has plenty of room for international expansion. In the US, there's one store per 35,000 people, while Europe has one per 298,000. China boasts one per 20,000, and India has just one per 5.3 million. These figures demonstrate the vast untapped market potential Starbucks possesses. The company's goal of reaching 55,000 stores by 2030 reflects their commitment to further growth.

To assess Starbucks' intrinsic value, I constructed a free cash flow discount model. My assumptions include:

* Revenue growth of 8% with a 32% reinvestment rate until 2030.
* Subsequent 12 years of revenue growth at 4% with a 25% reinvestment rate, acknowledging the potential for slower growth as the company matures.
* Long-term, sustainable growth of 2%.
* Operating margin improvement from 15.5% to 20%.
* Tax rate increase from 25% to 32% to account for potential future government regulations.
* Discount rate of 6%, based on the average US government bond return.

Based on this model, my calculated intrinsic value for Starbucks is $112 per share.

Overall, Starbucks' strong financial performance, combined with their substantial growth potential, makes them a compelling investment opportunity. My valuation model incorporates realistic assumptions, making a strong case for Starbucks' long-term success.

72,wallstreetbets,"All in on obesity, Calls on Calories","Disclaimer: I’m a potato who is morbidly stupid and obese. Don’t listen to me. Do your own DD.

TL;DR Buy Novo Nordisk because it’s undervalued with huge forward looking potential.

Four main points:



1. Novo Nordisk is undervalued relative to Eli Lilly
2. Novo Nordisk is getting their existing drugs approved for more valuable uses
3. Novo Nordisk is supply constrained. This is a solvable issue
4. Novo Nordisk will hopefully get a pill drug approved (vs an injection), making it easier to consume

Novo Nordisk has a great business model. Help people lose weight &amp; live longer. And you need to stay on on their drugs to keep weight off (so you stay on it forever). And the longer people live, the longer they’ll buy GLP-1 drugs, the more money Novo Nordisk makes. But who cares if you can’t make money? I’ll tell you how degens



1. Novo Nordisk is undervalued relative to Eli Lilly

Novo Nordisk:



* Market cap: 436 B
* Net Sales Growth: +31%
   * Earnings Per Share Growth: +52%
   * Net Profit Growth: +51%
* 2023 Revenue: $33.7 billion
* Net Profit Margin: 36%

Eli Lilly:



* Market cap: 745 B
* Net sales growth: +20%
   * Earnings per share: -16%
   * Net profit Change: -16%
* 2023 Revenue: $34.1 billion
* Net Income Margin: 15.3%

Comparing Novo Nordisk to Eli Lilly (their closest competitor), you can see Eli Lilly has a much higher market cap with MUCH worse financials. Now, that doesn’t mean Eli Lilly is a bad business (pls don’t short). But it means that Novo Nordisk, in my opinion, is UNDERVALUED. All their financial metrics BLOW Eli Lilly’s out of the water.

Hell, Eli Lilly literally decreasd their net profits by 16% YoY whereas Novo Nordisk increased their net profits by 51% YoY.

The numbers speak for themselves.



1. Novo Nordisk is getting their existing drugs approved for more valuable uses

In their latest financial report, Novo Nordisk says an FDA decision for Wegovy to become the first “approved weight management medicine \[that\] has been shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular death” is expected in 2024 (aka this year). And the FDA is doing a “priority review”.

Why is this a big deal?

Because according to the CDC, heart disease and stroke are literally the biggest disease and biggest economic opportunity.

That means Wegovy has now just opened itself up to the largest $$$ opportunity.



1. Novo Nordisk is supply constrained. This is a solvable issue

Demand is there. In fact, they literally say in their financial report they have to ration their drugs and prioritize certain populations.

The biggest bottleneck is manufacturing. Which is what they’re heavily investing in. Long term, if half the world is on these drugs, manufacturing and supply chain become a moat because getting drugs out the door at scale becomes the problem.

“If you produce it, they will come”



1. Novo Nordisk will hopefully get a pill drug approved (vs an injection), making it easier to consume

Today, you have to get a once a week injection. No one likes that.

But Novo Nordisk will (hopefully) solve that with a pill that you take.

Now if you’re too lazy to workout and get an injection, you can just get a pill delivered to your door and lose weight.

There are some risks. Like competition from Eli Lilly. But my opinion is the market is very unsaturated. All glp-1 companies can grow because there's still so many people who have never used a glp-1 drug. Many companies will win. A rising tide will lift all ships.

The other big risk factor is a bad side effect. But glp-1 drugs have been around for a while so while there is a risk, the research feels relatively de-risked.

So yeah, go all in on Novo Nordisk.

73,wallstreetbets,Preliminary Analysis UnitedHealth Inc. (NYSE:UNH),"**Disclaimers**: I am not a financial, tax, or legal advisor. This due diligence is made solely for fun/private usage, and should be considered as such. This ""DD"" is not meant to be considered as anything more than an opinion and should be teated as definitive proof of any future events. The information in this presentation is based upon any information supplied to me and reflects prevailing conditions and my views as of this date, of which are suspect to Change. My estimates should be regarded as preliminary and for illustrative purposes only. \*There bot, can't get me now.

1. **Market Perception**\- The Healthcare industry right now is suffering due to the hack on Change Healthcare by UnitedHealth and on medicare. My wife works in healthcare, and claims have not been paid where she works since 1/31. Earnings for all healthcare companies will be down due to the lack of money coming in from Change Healthcare, Medicare, etc. With COVID, we saw pharmaceuticals shoot up and healthcare as a whole shoot up due to the federal government paying a premium for a vaccine and giving money to cases billed under COVID. We have seen a reduction in different sectors, but this could be detrimental to a few companies that are affected by this hack.

[Important Info on Cyberattack](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/unitedhealth-hack-6tb-data-leak/) - There is something fishy going on here. If the cybergroup- ALPV was paid a ransom of $22 million dollars, wouldn't this fiasco be over. I think the state department stopped the payment, and this is the reason this has yet to be resolved. 

[State Department offers $10 million reward for info on ALPV](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/state-department-offers-10-million-193557172.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20v&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKZ0PkMf2v70DTz5pnbPMnU-HKXE0WEetRETWwIGuorARJkFDBkOGLY4YUV3-FbX-ELvJf3zl727cyEdumDkFP5McFa878Vl2GpuQHtT7MERvkwr-4EY164G7qwkGw1VXCaiFtvxGmDdKMbEbk7CIOk-bh6pdZUJeUUpN_wFZrMD) - We can deduce that they are actively pursuing this group, but has yet to be resolved.

[The Latest Reason why Healthcare stocks fell](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/humana-tumbles-unitedhealth-and-cvs-slide-on-medicare-advantage-hit)- the news is not covering this enough and I think Medicare advantage rates are not the reason for this movement that happened. 

**2.** UnitedHealth has been a leader in the U.S. Healthcare industry. We could see movement to other healthcare stocks that dealth with these hacks better or were not affected by this hack. I think they will rebound when this resolves and they get through their backlog of claims that have yet to be filed, but their Q1 earnings (4/16) will be affected as well as other companies that rely on insurance and were affected by the hack.

[Unusual Options Activity UNH](https://www.benzinga.com/insights/options/24/04/38069812/unitedhealth-group-unusual-options-activity)- If we look at the chart on down we can see the tremendous put options that were recently bought vs open interest. Someone knows something or has a big hunch they are going down.

**3.** Some alternatives to this stock- Elevance stock, which owns BlueCross BlueShield, went through a similar experience and came back strong to a stock price of 507.35. We could see movement of investors to this stock if earnings reports are abysmal. (More than likely will be) My personal opinion is that the healthcare industry as a whole is not doing good right now though, so we could see this across the board. 

[The Best Link](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/tech/cyberattack-health-insurance-doctors-therapists/index.html)- $100 million per day lost by healthcare providers in an industry with not a lot of cash on hand. It is not sustainable, and something needs to be done or these providers could file for bankruptcy. Also, in this article, Elevance has severed ties with this company. Good move Elevance.

[Communications with Hack](https://www.wsj.com/articles/unitedhealth-grapples-with-communications-during-hack-crisis-b1dfccd8)- They are trying to change the narrative by getting providers to publicaly announce upbeat statements. Trying to save face, but it is not working.

**Bull Case**- They will get this resolved and go back to their normal self. Technicals show it is at support, so it has to go up.

**Bear Case**\- Earnings (4/16) will be terrible, and we break the support and large investors look to move their positions to more reputable companies that don't have ties with this hack or UNH. 

**My personal position**\- UNH $410 Put 5/3

**TLDR:** Buy UNH Puts

74,wallstreetbets,"Cummins ide me, Daddy: A $9.7 Billion Dollar Gay Bear Tail Thesis (CMI)","For those of you regards that are too pussy to YOLO 0DTE SPY puts, you'll love this because a SPY drawdown would cause this theory to execute as well since CMI currently trends closely with the SPY.

First, if you don't know Cummins, they make arguably the best Diesel engines on planet earth. If you're a Suits fan, think McKernon motors, but for Diesel trucks. Historically, they're an incredibly stable company and have been in the business for a longgg time out of Indiana. So why puts?

Well, the first thing that caught my eye, was a MASSIVE lawsuit they just [settled with the EPA to the tune of $1.7 billion](https://apnews.com/article/cummins-doj-settlement-engine-emissions-claims-b80708c6ebe8eb7e7a3684db0837e209) for *allegedly* (absolutely) using emission defeat devices and violating the Clean Air Act. And the promise to recall all one million RAM trucks to make them emission compliant. They've already paid the fine, but the recall costs are still coming in hot. This settlement has opened the flood gates, as they're now getting sued by [shareholders and Dodge Ram truck owners](https://www.therepublic.com/2024/02/19/cummins-faces-shareholder-and-customer-lawsuits-after-2b-settlement/). 

This alone doesn't mean shit for me (although it does add to the Bear case), but there is some fuckery afoot that caused some red flags to rise.

During the midst of all this legal drama, Cummins has finalized a full separation from their sister company, [Atmus Filtration](https://www.cummins.com/news/releases/2024/02/14/cummins-launches-exchange-offer-separation-atmus-filtration-technologies). This dissolution and subsequent stock exchange program for Cummins investors [finalized on MARCH 13th, 2024](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240318925736/en/Cummins-Announces-Final-Results-of-Exchange-Offer-and-Finalizes-Separation-of-Atmus-Filtration-Technologies-Inc).

Why is that important? Well, I'm not entirely sure how much revenue/influence Atmus had on Cummins stock, but apparently this decision impacted hedge fund sentiments in a very big way. Here's the [SI on CMI](https://fintel.io/ss/us/cmi) from August through March:

[32,498,522 Shares is a $9,771,330,609 short investment at current price](https://preview.redd.it/vuxe99yds5tc1.png?width=528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04739ca4795079bab4e6aeca00851152e05b19e7)

Remember that the first article to finalize dissolution was February 14th, where we see a bump from 1,983,145 to 3,231,342 SI, just a casual 63% increase. But what's remarkable is that once the dissolution is finalized in March the SI jumps to 32,498,522, or 24% of the Float. This is a 1,529% increase from January 31st!!

This is fascinating because the company has actually outperformed the SPY, even since that date. I may be a smooth brain, but knowing that the price was \~$270 mid march, that means shorts are currently looking at a billion++ dollar loss if the price stays at $300+.

So why now? Earnings.

CMI earnings date is 4/30/24 and this is their first earnings since the new lawsuits, the Atmus dissolution finalization, and their guidance during Q4 literally stated they expect a drop in revenue between 2-5% just from market forces, not even considering these other factors. They've also had declining EPS for four straight quarters, yet their expected EPS is $5.11, a number they've only beat ONCE in the last decade. Definitely feels like analysts are setting them up to fail so the rug pull can be explained.

This just ***feels*** like insider trading/knowledge of either more Government hits; lawsuits; or Atmus Filtration dissolution implications that laymen don't understand. Whatever it is, I'm tailing the big money on this one. Wish me luck, regards!

TL;DR - Big money going gay bear mode Cumming(s) all over an engine company that just got dodge Rammed by the EPA, no filter.

75,wallstreetbets,4/10 Will be a good day for $TSM,"**EDIT: added a hindsight report the morning of 4/10. Find it at the bottom of the text wall**

**EDIT: added a graph for those of you who don't know how to read**

Did a little DD on $TSM since they report revenue monthly (4/10) and earnings is coming up and figured I'd share with you lovely apes.

Based on [$TSM's historical revenue data](https://investor.tsmc.com/english/monthly-revenue/2024) along with the little bit of analysis I did (see below), I reckon April will be a beast of a month for $TSM.

Historically, March is the best month every year for TSMC in terms of % improvement from the previous month with 15% improvement on average over the last 18 years worth of data (over the last 4 years only, March is tied with August for the best MoM % improvement). February is the worst in both categories, averaging -12%.

You can see below that I calculated (based on all 18 years of data) the revenue report next week to be hovering around *$209k*, although this is ***most likely*** incorrect due to a couple factors, one being the insane success behind NVDA, who is TSMC's second largest customer just behind Apple (but I wouldn't be surprised if Nvidia takes the #1 spot due to regulations cracking down on Apple), and two being that the MoM % improvement averages are somewhat skewed to the high end due to the rapid growth experienced by TSMC in the late 2010's &amp; early 2020's (specifically March 2018 with a MoM % improvement of 60). To mitigate this, I did did a second set of averages from the last 3 years only. With these averages, I figure that the revenue report will most likely hover somewhere around *$203k*.

I am confident that the revenue report will fall somewhere between or perhaps slightly above the range of $203k-$209k simply due to NVDA.

Should CPI and inflation announcements come out in the market's favor, I see no reason why we couldn't see upwards of a 15% gain on the share price mid next week.

EDIT: currency is New Taiwan Dollars, didn't feel like converting, sns

EDIT: delete my own stupidity, some initial confusion I had about the data but am now sure of

Hindsight Report, added the morning of 4/10 pre-market:

TSMC’s revenue report came in at 195k, a whopping 34% YoY increase from March of 2023, and a mere 8k short of my low-end prediction; however, the stock spiked very high just before the report was released, then fell off pretty quick shortly after the report was released, I imagine it experienced a little bit of a pump-and-dump over in the Taiwan market. This is most likely due to the report coming out after close in Taiwan. CPI came it at 0.1% over estimate and there was a big overreaction in pretty much every sector. Since this is such a small gap, I don’t think the dip will last long, and I am still bullish for earnings.

77,wallstreetbets,RH and BLK and coming earnings and why I shorted RH ?! What about BLK?,"Let's see if I can summarize this here. I have been short on RH for some time now. Before making my conclusions, I examined the following data. First off, I want to say that my research led me to believe that the product's quality is not that great. I live in NYC, and RH has an outlet here in Industry City, which is in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Their prices are overextended, which I attribute to RH's thorough research. They know that the average household income of families residing in the surrounding areas exceeds $250k per year. I am pretty sure their outlets are in similar locations for the exact same reason: it's a simple profit/loss ratio, and RH knows that the higher profit margin will offset the higher average carrying expenses. So, why would I short the stock and bet against RH? My first reason was the low home sales. Interest rates have risen quite a bit; a 30-year fixed rate is above 7%, and most homebuyers would try to maximize their savings by purchasing furniture from one of RH's competitors. RH supposedly manufactures their furniture pieces in China. Full disclosure, I have no idea where exactly it is made, but a simple Google search will tell you that. Follow this link for more information: \[link to furniture manufacturing details\].

Have consumers been complaining about the product or the quality of the product? You can read the reviews for yourself here: \[link to consumer reviews\].

Now, my reasoning was that since home sales have been down, and the quality of the furniture is not pleasing to the average consumer, and in general, people are not furnishing their new houses, RH would likely miss their analysts' earnings call and underperform. Well, this is exactly what happened. The adjusted net revenue of $738 million missed the consensus mark of $777 million by 5% and fell by 4.4% on a year-over-year basis. The revenue decline was attributed to ""several weather"" events in January and shipping delays related to the ongoing conflict in the Red Sea. RH missed Q4 earnings and revenue estimates. RH reported quarterly earnings of $0.71 per share, missing the estimated earnings of $1.71 per share.

Logically, one would expect that the price per share of the stock would drop accordingly to account for the revenue loss. However, we witnessed the opposite; the price per share went up by almost 18% after the earnings announcement.

Let's not forget that the short interest before the earnings call was more than 51%.

According to the data and common sense consensus, everyone should have expected that since RH did not meet expectations, the price per share would come down to adjust the value based on performance. This did not happen. On the contrary, the price went up, and shorts got squeezed.

Could this be manipulation? No way, this is a fair commodity, a self-regulated market, and manipulations are not possible.

Now, let's talk about the biggest institutional investors behind RH. It turns out that the largest shareholders include Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc.

I am trying to find any correlation between the price movement of RH's stock and BLK's, but my indicators are not refined enough to discover the precise connection, and I would leave this to the readers.

Anyway, why am I talking about RH and a potential connection with market movement and the price of BLK's stock? Well, BLK is set to announce earnings this coming Friday, April 12th.

So, some scenarios could possibly aid the retail investor's decision. How overstretched are the big funds, and could they go down because their investment assets have come down in price? Let's not forget LULU... What are your bets? Are you playing calls or puts on BLK?

A fellow regard posted his DD on the company a year ago, and he was right on the money. I'm here to tell you that even after this insane run up, its still not too late to get on this ride.

Despite bearish sentiment since their recent earnings, the stock's performance is backed up with improving fundamentals. If the business improves, its stock price will improve. It's strange to see cases where it doesn't happen over time.

I'll go through most of the important information from their financial statements:

**Revenue TTM:** from 3.7b to 4.28b

**ROA TTM:** from 0.1 to 11.54

**ROIC TTM:** from 0.16 to 18.18

**ROE TTM:** from 0.37 to 37.93

**Gross Margin TTM:** from 52.97 to 59.67

**Operating Margin TTM:** from 2.44 to 11.23

**Net Margin TTM:** from 0.08 to 7.67

**Debt to Equity ratio TTM:** from 1.76 to 1.01

**Total assets:** from 2.71b to 2.94b

**Total liabilities:** from 2.01b to 1.92b

**Total debt:** from 1.22b to 1.05

**Net debt:** from 706.59m to 147.48m

The only thing that was somewhat negative was that EPS was beaten only by 5%, the smallest out of the last 4 quarters.

I think its also important to mention a crucial element of this stock and that is the reduction of 30% of their float. Over the course of the last 6 years, the float was reduced from 65m outstanding to 49m outstanding, yet the price movement didn't respond accordingly. Only once the business made a turnaround, the price finally started it's ascend. In fact, the float was increased in the current year from 49m to 51m.

Almost every single aspect of the company and financial health improved in the recent quarter, yet the market decided that because the EPS was beaten by just 5%, it means its the end of world.

Will we see the same returns over the coming year? probably not

But I think this is a case of the ""stock is up this much, its can't possibly go any higher"" fallacy

I'm long on this position, but im guessing around 50-60% upside in the near future

**What the Hell is PECO?**

**PECO,** or Phillips Edison &amp; Company, ""is one of the nation’s largest owners and operators of omni-channel grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers. PECO’s centers feature a mix of national and regional retailers selling necessity-based goods and services in fundamentally strong markets throughout the United States and its top grocery anchors include **Kroger**, Publix, **Albertsons**, and Ahold Delhaize. PECO remains exclusively focused on creating great omni-channel grocery-anchored shopping experiences and improving communities, one center at a time."" **I copy and pasted all of this.**

Guess who PECO's two of their three largest tenants are? If you guessed Kroger, KR, and Albertsons, you are correct. **KR represent the largest percentage of PECO's** annualized base rent, while Albertson's represents the **third largest percentage of PECO's annualized base rent.**

I think that the FTC rules in Kroger's favor come August, states that Walmart is a supermarket, and allows the Kroger and Albertsons merge to move forward.

Badly.,"I couldn't sleep last night, so I began looking through Uber's last earnings results because there seems to be a major disconnect between sentiment towards the stock and my own perceived experience with their service (which is to say not good).

And boy did I find something interesting hidden in there.

For the three months ended on December 31st, 2023, they reported net income of $1.43 billion. That represents a 141% year over year increase and 66 cents per share against expectations of 17 cents- not bad at all. Way to go Dara!

https://preview.redd.it/ygiyo0h18psc1.png?width=722&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd5bb92852115b714901840476c4d6051198d58c

Let's dig into the numbers and see how they got such a massive increase.

https://preview.redd.it/amb9cpk28psc1.png?width=1003&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16b1385156e6dabb81cf05ebc73139833581ea51

Here we can see that they are showing $1 billion from unrealized gains on debt and equity securities. The year prior that number was $752 million. So they are counting unrealized marked to market gains on their stock holdings as if they are net income from the business. Interesting. Let's examine further.

From the 10-Q:

***Income from operations was $652 million, up $794 million YoY and $258 million quarter-over-quarter (“QoQ”).***

Soooo, if my math is correct, they made $652 million from operations and $1 billion from unrealized capital gains, so essentially two thirds of their reported profit was from unrealized gains. So what are those holdings that made them so much paper money?

Later from the 10-Q:

***During the three months ended December 31, 2023, unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net primarily represents changes in the fair value of our equity securities including: a $659 million unrealized gain on our Aurora investment, a $414 million unrealized gain on our Didi investment, partially offset by a $91 million unrealized loss on our Grab investment.***

So they have three major holdings:

* Aurora Innovations
* Didi
* Grab

They say they ""earned"" $659 million from their Aurora investment, $414 million from Didi, and lost $91 million from Grab.

So how much of these companies does Uber own? If we go by this headline from last summer, we can figure its about 326 million shares of Aurora:

https://preview.redd.it/1dmrlmf48psc1.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0a6dfab21333c95ebc572991e204ffe8e85b0c8

So if they made $659 million in three months, the stock must have appreciated about $2.

Let's looks at the charts from Q3 (10/1/23-12/31/23):

https://preview.redd.it/ps61s2w68psc1.png?width=785&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5ad0fdbcb379c8e192f5b03c8a7fc8b94843237

This one looks interesting. On September 29th, AUR closed at $2.35. On December 29th (the last trading day of 2023), it closed at $4.37. Wait- that's $2.02! Exactly the amount they reported times their holdings of 326 million shares!

Similarly, on September 29th, DIDIY closed at $3.23 and on December 29th, it closed at $3.95, for a nice $0.72 gain. Given that they reported a $414 million gain in the same period on that investment, they must own about 575 million shares.

Finally, GRAB closed on September 29th at $3.54, and December 29th at $3.37, for a loss of $0.17. Given that they claim a loss of $91 million in that period, they must own about 535 million shares.

Okay, so to summarize, Uber reported $1 billion of profit off three unrealized gains:

* Aurora Innovations ($659 million gain)
* Didi ($414 million gain)
* Grab ($91 million loss)

It seems a bit sketchy to me that 2/3 of profit was reported on unrealized gains in a very speculative portfolio, but whatever, the market seems fine with it.

But that begs the question, wasn't the bulk of their profit due to the happenstance price movements of two stocks in a three month period? What happens if they are flat or (gasp!) down in the next three months?

Well, let's see how those three investments fared in the last quarter, now that it is in the books:

https://preview.redd.it/4qn9q9eb8psc1.png?width=787&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7966a528e737ed7ecde768468971b64ec97e987a

First up, as previously stated, GRAB closed on 12/29/23 at $3.37. And on 3/28/24 (the last trading day of the quarter) it closed at $3.14, showing a loss of $0.23. Given Uber's holdings of 535 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $123 million.

https://preview.redd.it/o0y52wtd8psc1.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8dab9c4010d06df0edb55f86ba7dacdbdaf4874

Next up DIDIY. As stated, it closed on 12/29/23 at $3.95, and on 3/28/24 it closed at $3.83, showing a loss of $0.12. Given Uber's holdings of 575 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $69 million. Nice.

Now for the punchline. Let's check last quarter's big winner, Aurora.

https://preview.redd.it/tsc6is8f8psc1.png?width=787&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a95c6c9b0af60f894ce5819ad3f3e79546f0ccf4

Wow, that don't looks so good. As stated, on 12/29/23 AUR closed at $4.37 and on it closed at $2.82, for a loss of $1.55. Given Uber's holdings of 326 million shares, that represents a loss of $505 million!

So let's tally up the damage here:

* Grab: $123 million loss
* Didi: $69 million loss
* Aurora: $505 million loss

So in total, Uber lost $697 million in the last quarter on the very same investments that made them $1 billion in the prior quarter. The market, she giveth and she taketh away.

Meanwhile, analysts are estimating $0.21 per share, which equates to $420 million. Given the $697 million shortfall we already know about that's a near certainty and very easy to verify, that means that Uber would have to earn a profit of $1.1 billion from operations alone just to meet expectations! That would be roughly double the profit that they made last quarter. It turns out the unrealized gains pendulum swings both ways.

TL;DR- Uber reports unrealized gains (and losses) as part of their profit every quarter. Last quarter was a major anomaly during the year end chase for two of their holdings, Didi and Aurora. Aurora promptly collapsed right after the quarter began, largely reversing a major profit driver from last quarter. Short this stock for easy money.

As an aside, this begs the question what other companies report paper gains as real profits and benefited from last quarter's massive run?

As such, this unprecedented buyback program sent the stock skyrocketing, far above a fair price, with a PE ratio of 80, for a non-growing airline, while other airlines have been roughly flat during this period (see the ETF $JETS)

  
However, that share buyback program is almost over. Considering that SKYW is now at an all time high, with oil prices as high as they are, once their buying pressure ceases in the near future I expect SKYW to drop such that it's overall performance over this time period will have mirrored other airlines, i.e. the share price will go back to the $20-$30 range compared to its current price of $70.

84,wallstreetbets,Gogoro Q1 Recap,"**Q1 Scooter Sales in Taiwan**

March sales numbers in Taiwan are out. As a reminder Taiwan covers 95% of Gogoro's revenue currently. This year Gogoro exceptionally launched new scooters in January (Pulse) and February (JEGO) so the comparison is not straight forward to last year. Considering actual orders instead of deliveries Gogoro has established +27% growth in Q1.

YTD 2024 sales 7,321 scooters (last year 10,593).

https://preview.redd.it/tb4pa3g0lmsc1.png?width=496&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10c7c722c6b1922a0bb8dcfacb1bb60b1031814b

However, a big bunch of scooters have been ordered but not yet delivered (not in stats):

\- Pulse pre-orders: 1,400 (25 units in March numbers, 90% most expensive model)  
\- JEGO pre-orders: 5,300 (577 mostly trial vehicles in March stats).

***Actual orders in Q1: 13,419 (+27% compared to last year).***

A quick analysis of sales: Gogoro exceeded Q1 orders compared to last year, a positive development. However, reported Q1 numbers might appear lower due to deliveries scheduled for Q2. Nonetheless, expectations are for strong Q2 figures. Hopefully, Taiwan sales maintain their growth trajectory throughout 2024, with anticipated positive news from international markets.

**Product Launch Analysis - JEGO and Pulse**

I've been hoping for Gogoro to replicate what Apple did with the iPhone SE—an affordable option with great specs that appeals to cost-conscious consumers, while still maintaining premium flagship products. This parallels the Pulse vs. JEGO product positioning.

It's noteworthy that JEGO garnered 5,300 orders in a month, especially when considering the broader 2023 sales per model. This indicates significant potential, provided sales continue on their current trajectory and Viva orders remain stable.

Pulse has received 1,400 orders already and there is a lot of hype in the air as it's clearly the best EV in the market in its class. Reviews have been good and what comes to sales it will be interesting to follow how SuperSport sales figures will be impacted in the future.

**Gogoro Partner News**

March 15: Zypp Electric achieved the remarkable distinction of being named the top-ranked company in the Financial Times and Statista's annual ranking of high-growth Asia-Pacific companies – an incredible accomplishment!

With Gogoro's leadership, Zypp secured $25 million in Series B funding and solidified its position as Gogoro's strategic partner in India. They have recently placed orders for the first batches of locally manufactured scooters in their B2B fleet. I'm eagerly anticipating further orders as the battery swapping network expands and Zypp continues to extend its presence.

[https://www.ft.com/high-growth-asia-pacific-ranking-2024](https://www.ft.com/high-growth-asia-pacific-ranking-2024)

April 3: Zypp Electric posts 3x revenue growth in FY24 and is now operationally profitable. Zypp is Gogoro's major partner in India so it's absolutely great news. 

 ""On the fleet front, we intend to grow our current strength of 20,000 to around 100,000 vehicles in the next 12 to 18 months and then grow that to 500,000 over the following 36 to 48 months.""

**Governmental Support for EVs is Part of Sustainability Megatrend**

\- Taiwan: current EV adoption is 9% and the goal is to reach 35% by 2030. Gogoro has plenty of potential in Taiwan and government continues provide considerable subsidies.  
\- India: government has raised EV charging ecosystem support in one of their main goal in the near future.  
\- South Korea: subsidies to EVs available.  
\- The Philippines: Executive Order 12 defines that EV vehicles tariff fee is 0% instead of 30%. Two-wheelers are not included but there is a EO 12 yearly review ongoing to remove the tax from two-wheelers as well. Basically all relevant parties support the amendment and it is likely to happen in the coming months. In practise it would mean that Gogoro scooter resale prices would drop about 30% in the country and boost EV adoption.

**Gogoro's Key Metrics and Good to Know:**

\- Best battery swapping product/services in the market.  
\- Company has $173.9 million cash balance and they are controlling costs efficiently.  
\- Gogoro has invested $650-$700 million to Taiwan's battery swapping network.  
\- Sticky and growing subscriber base generating significant amount revenue. Number of subscribers at the end of Q4/2023 was 587,000, so pre-orders included the subscriber is now close to 600,000.  
\- 95% of revenue from Taiwan currently. Goal is to increase international revenue to 10% this year (main focus in India).

**Battery Swapping Network**

\- Over 1,3 million batteries in circulation.  
\- Taiwan: 13501 racks in 2584 locations.  
\- South Korea: estimated 600 racks in 200 locations.  
\- India: getting started in Delhi. 75 racks in 25 locations. Goal is to have 100+ locations by the mid 2024. India long-term potential at least 20x compared to Taiwan (Gogoro's estimate).  
\- Other networks/pilots ongoing in: China, The Philippines, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, Colombia, Chile and Israel.

**Share Price**

\- SPAC listing price $10 and now at $1.69 (5th of April).

What do they make? EV batteries. Who drives places? Everybody. It's simple. Cars don't work without batteries. Tesla just got rocked by that Chinese company who is selling their cars cheaper. Maybe they've got a better battery supplier. Maybe it's SGML. Maybe not but who knows.

The Hershey Company is known for their chocolate bars but they also sell many other snacks and candy using over 20 different brand names including Jolly Rancher, and Kit Kat. While they pride themselves as a smile spreading company that attempts to create tasty memories like roasting s'mores over a campfire, they do a lot of research and testing under the hood. They have a division dedicated to public perception and where their products will be best suited for sale. Michelle Buck, CEO of the company even states ""our retail partners transition to a storytelling role"" meaning they can sell more chocolate by engaging with the customer more.

By transitioning their marketing approach, they are now selling more than chocolate. They are turning chocolate into an emotion to latch onto and associate with their brand. On their website there is minimal mentions of the word chocolate. They are leaning into their name becoming an almost generic term for chocolate and are now focusing on making chocolate a necessary part of the general publics lives.

87,wallstreetbets,$CVNA: Sky-High Valuation Is a House of Cards,"Carvana (CVNA) is significantly overvalued, with a strong case for an imminent decline in share price.

**Unsustainable Valuation:** Carvana's valuation at $19 billion, representing a 49x EV/2024E EBITDA multiple, is deemed absurd and unsustainable, especially given the company's mixed 4Q23 results and underwhelming growth outlook. This valuation places Carvana at a premium not just relative to auto dealers but also leading tech companies, despite lacking comparable growth prospects or profitability. To reach the current stock price, it's not just necessary for EBITDA per unit to double, but also for vehicle sales and revenue to increase at an improbable compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18% over a period of seven years.

**Profitability and Growth Concerns:** Despite efforts to improve profitability to mitigate balance sheet crises, Carvana's growth is challenged. The anticipation for a return to meaningful growth is contradicted by a mere ""slight"" unit growth projection for 1Q24, signaling that profitability enhancements may be nearing their limits.

**Comparison with CarMax:** Carvana's operational metrics, particularly gross profit per retail unit (GPU), have plateaued, reaching levels consistent with CarMax but without exhibiting any remarkable edge over the industry leader. This comparison undermines Carvana's positioning as a disruptor in the auto retail sector. As former Carvana executives said, the company is ""just a dealership. 

**Operational Inefficiencies and Market Misconceptions:** Carvana's operational efficiencies and market positioning, suggesting that the company's past growth was achieved by overlooking fundamental industry practices rather than through disruptive innovation. Carvana's improvement strategies, especially in vehicle reconditioning and logistics, largely mimic those of CarMax, challenging the narrative of Carvana as a unique tech-driven entity.

**Growth Versus Profitability Dilemma:** Carvana faces a dilemma between pursuing aggressive growth and maintaining profitability. The operational and strategic shifts required for growth could compromise the company's recent profitability achievements, a risk exacerbated by the tight job market and supply constraints in the used vehicle sector.

**Valuation and Price Target:** The price target of $16, a 77% decline from current levels, is based on a 12x multiple to their estimated 2026E EBITDA, aligning Carvana's valuation more closely with CarMax and reflecting the operational and financial realities facing Carvana.

## Big Tobacco Lost Revenue Due to Disposable Vapes

Let’s start with the bad, the kind of really bad. However, we will show you why it doesn’t matter much towards the end. But it’s true, analysts have concluded that [**disposable vapes are hurting Altria’s cigarette sales**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/129123/financial-analyst-disposable-vapes-killing-altrias-cigarette-sales). They reported a loss of 10% of sales by shipping volume and a 2% decline in EBIT. 

## Big Tobacco and Big Pharma are Fighting Back by Lobbying Against the Vape Industry

Losing 10% of your revenue is a big deal. So what do you do when you’re the big sheriff in town? You act like a fucking sheriff and use your guns. Altria [**sued everyone in the vape industry**](https://www.cstoredive.com/news/retailers-expect-boost-njoy-altria-goldman-sachs/689111/) and started [**lobbying to ban vapes**](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/altria-is-backing-us-states-moves-to-crack-down-on-illegal-vapes-1.2048274). Shit’s about to get serious for the vaping industry, like pretty fucking bad.

## PMTA Registered List

Altria bought some lawmakers in [**28 states**](https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/resources/state-e-cigarette-registry-bill-map) and convinced them to write bills that ban a bunch of vapes. Smoke shops can only sell shit that is PMTA permitted ([**don’t even get me started on PMTA approvals**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/128052/fifth-circuit-court-rips-fda-grants-triton-appeal/)). Turns out there's only a handful of products that are approved and surprise! [**They’re all made by big tobacco**](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/premarket-tobacco-product-applications/premarket-tobacco-product-marketing-granted-orders). Monopoly aint just a game it means we eat more tendies.

So Altria’s bills passed in at least 3 states already ([**Utah**](https://www.abc4.com/news/politics/gov-cox-signs-bill-banning-flavored-vape-products/), Virginia, [**Kentucky**](https://www.weku.org/the-commonwealth/2024-03-31/vape-product-inventories-at-kentucky-retailers-could-look-different-in-the-years-ahead)), but it was already law in Louisiana, Alabama, Wisconsin &amp; Oklahoma - they just weren't enforcing it… until [**two weeks ago**](https://www.nola.com/news/louisiana-atc-resumes-vape-ban-enforcement/article_c394fedc-e181-11ee-ac6d-37b83bd90b70.html). **Expect the bill to pass in lots of other states.** 2024 will bring heavy regulation on the vaping industry, which will only help Altria.

## Altria is Creating Their Own Flavored Bluetooth Disposable Vape

So Altria wants to ban flavored vapes? Well, sort of but not really. Altria wants disposable vapes to be illegal, except theirs! Theyre working on a [**bluetooth disposable vape with flavors**](https://www.tobaccojournal.com/news/altria-plans-to-use-bluetooth-for-flavoured-vapes/) and they will bypass the laws AND get it PMTA accepted because it has Bluetooth technology to verify if you’re underage or not. And they will get it approved because Big Tobacco basically owns the FDA - [**100% of FDA’s tobacco department funding comes from big tobacco**](https://www.theamericanconsumer.org/2023/03/fda-should-reexamine-incentives-to-collect-tobacco-user-fees-fairly/).

## Altria’s On! Nicotine Pouches - ZYNs Biggest Competitor

In case you didn’t know, all the main nicotine pouches that are popping up everywhere are owned by Big Tobacco. Altria is in on it with their On! Nicotine pouches. Altria had shipment issues in 2023 but they’re expected to double revenues from On! Nicotine pouches to [**a little over $5 billion**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-sell-altria-group-123000564.html).

At the end of the day, Big Tobacco wins. If you smoke cigarettes, they got that covered. If you wanna vape, they have the only vapes allowed on the market. If you wanna stuff your gourd with nic pouches like a cracked-out squirrel, hit up Altria. Smoking rates may be going down, but nicotine consumption rates are not.

## Altria’s “Moving Beyond Smoking” Plan

Altria is dead set on its new campaign, “[**Moving Beyond Smoking**](https://www.altria.com/en/moving-beyond-smoking)”. They know smoking rates are declining so they’re repositioning to other products like smokeless products, aka On!, and they just bought the #3 vape on the market too, Njoy. That’s why Morningstar says they’re worth $49 and Stifel has em at $50 and so many others say it’s a value stock.

## Bonus Altria is planning on selling its shares of AB InBev

Altria just sold $2 billion worth of AB Inbev (Bud Light) and is flush with cash ready to buyback shares and further increase the share price or inject that sweet sweet capital into their new line of bluetooth vapes. Finally, with [**jobless claims at a 9-week high**](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240404273/jobless-claims-climb-to-nine-week-high-of-221000-but-theres-little-sign-of-worsening-labor-market), expect even more people to use nicotine as a way to cope with their shitty lives ([**1**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5896540/), [**2**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255976561_Effect_of_economic_crisis_on_smoking_prevalence_and_number_of_smokers_in_the_USA)) while they’re out looking for jobs and smoking cigarettes, we’ll be eating tendies and banging their wives.

I actually paid someone on a contracting website to find me undervalued publicly traded companies. (didn't cost too much). Of all the companies I was provided, this one stuck out like a sore thumb.  


The potential for a buyout is HUGE. In for $15 9/20 calls. I know I'm a chump for paying for this, but whatever here we go...

Here are the two reports I was given on ADEIA:

​

# Report 1 (Financials) 

Adeia, a company operating in the media and semiconductor intellectual property licensing sectors, has been active in forging significant deals and renewing licenses with major industry players. The company has reported strong financial results, with over $100 million in revenue, and [has successfully renewed intellectual property license agreements with giants like Samsung for mobile devices](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/adea/). This indicates a robust operational foundation and a promising outlook on its ability to generate revenue through its intellectual property portfolio.

Financially, Adeia has shown commendable performance. With a net margin of 17.33% and a pretax margin of 20.57%, the company's profitability ratios look strong. Furthermore, Adeia boasts a return on equity of 42.74% and a return on assets of 12.77%, indicating efficient use of shareholder equity and company assets. [The debt-to-equity ratio stands at 1.46, paired with a healthy current ratio of 2.02, suggesting a stable financial position with respect to short-term obligations](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ADEA/).

The valuation metrics provide a mixed bag. Adeia’s trailing PE ratio is 18.19, and its forward PE ratio significantly drops to 8.19, hinting at an anticipated increase in earnings. Additionally, with a beta of 1.14, Adeia's stock is slightly more volatile than the market, yet it has seen a 29.99% increase in price over the last 52 weeks. Analysts predict an average stock price target of $15.50 in the next year, suggesting a potential upside of 44.9% from its current price.

On the flip side, it's worth noting the company's market cap growth has been quite volatile, with significant fluctuations observed over recent periods. Such volatility may indicate a degree of market uncertainty or sector-specific risks that potential investors should be aware of.

Given its robust licensing strategy, strong financial performance, and positive analyst outlook, Adeia Inc. seems poised for growth. However, the inherent market and operational risks, reflected through its stock price volatility and market cap fluctuations, suggest a cautious approach. If you're considering an investment, it might be wise to keep a close eye on the company's ongoing developments and sector trends. Based on the data, Adeia seems to have the potential for a favorable return over a year's time, especially for investors with an appetite for a moderate level of risk and a keen eye on the tech and media sectors.

# Report 2 (Tech/News/Financials) 

Based on the research conducted, Adeia Inc. (ADEA) has been identified as an undervalued tech stock that is not widely discussed. The company's low P/E ratio of 10.72 and the interest of 16 hedge fund investors in Q2 2023 suggest that it may be undervalued by the market. The original prediction is that Adeia Inc. could experience growth in its stock value due to a market correction as investors recognize the company's value relative to its earnings, as well as the overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector. The detailed analysis for Adeia Inc. being undervalued includes its favorable P/E ratio, institutional confidence, strong performance of the tech sector, and the pivot towards AI and digitization. However, investors should conduct their own due diligence and consider the inherent volatility of tech stocks before making investment decisions.

Adeia Inc. has indeed made a significant breakthrough that might have not caught widespread attention yet. During the Chiplet Summit 2024, held from February 6 to 8 at the Santa Clara Convention Center, Adeia showcased its hybrid bonding technology. This technology is highlighted as a key enabler for next-generation high-performance semiconductor devices. By allowing the disaggregation of memory arrays and logic circuitry, hybrid bonding paves the way for the creation of new chiplet architectures. This innovation is being increasingly adopted in sensors, memory chips, and logic devices due to its potential to enhance performance and functionality while simultaneously reducing size and costs​​​​.

Adeia's hybrid bonding technology stands as a testament to the company's long-standing commitment to advancing the semiconductor industry. Over the past 30 years, Adeia has made fundamental advances in the field, holding an extensive portfolio of intellectual property that covers not just hybrid bonding but also advanced process nodes and packaging technologies​​​​. This latest development underscores Adeia's role in driving innovation in semiconductor technologies, which could have broad implications for the industry's future.",0.93,539,0,539,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'DD'}]"

LW missed earnings by a boatload as a surprise, blaming a transition to a new ERP system. 

“The transition to a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in North America negatively impacted our financial results in the quarter by more than we expected,” said Tom Werner, President and CEO. “The ERP transition temporarily reduced the visibility of finished goods inventories located at distribution centers, which affected our ability to fill customer orders. In turn, this pressured sales volume and margin performance. While we are disappointed with the magnitude of the ERP transition’s effect on the quarter, after implementing systems adjustments and modifying processes, we believe the impact is behind us as our order fulfillment rates have normalized.”

The CEO says order fulfillment rates have been normalized.

	•	Client dependency could pose strategic risks.

*Outlook:*

	•	GAAP net income of $770 million to $790 million, and Diluted EPS of $5.30 to $5.45
	•	Adjusted EBITDA(2) of $1,480 million to $1,510 million, which includes a temporary, higher-than-expected impact from the transition to a new ERP system in North America and a $96 million pre-tax charge(1) for the write-off of excess raw potatoes
	•	Adjusted Net Income(2) of $800 million to $820 million and Adjusted Diluted EPS(2) of $5.50 to $5.65”

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240404698637/en/Lamb-Weston-Reports-Fiscal-Third-Quarter-2024-Results-Updates-Fiscal-Year-2024-Outlook

While the outlook acknowledges impacts from the ERP system transition and a one-time charge for raw potatoes, the overall financial projections remain robust. These factors suggest a stable operational base with the potential for recovery and growth, marking a cautiously optimistic view for the company’s fiscal health in 2024.

Given the current financials and market position, LW appears to be in a temporary bearish phase due to the ERP transition but holds bullish potential for the long term.


I dont have financial advice but buying stock at the dip and holding long or buying leaps the safer bet to me, but we’re on wsb bay bay. Also I’m a regard and bought too early in the dip. I probably should have waited until things calm down a bit. But I’m gonna hold regardless. GLHF

NOTE: Given the big run up today, I cashed out today as ULTA hit 460.  If it pulls back down, I will be buying again, but it was prudent to take my profit today. Looking at the chart - the stock has done this a few times, where it will have a dead cat bounce, then more selling pressure, and ultimately recovery.  

While the market puked on the CEO's early soft guidance preview, I think this 15% haircut is an overreaction. A 5% slip? Sure. But a full-blown 15% beatdown? That's an opportunity.

A few reasons I'm backing up the truck on ULTA here:

💰 Best-in-class loyalty program driving stickier customer base and superior data

💄 Unique positioning as the only major player straddling prestige and mass beauty in an accessible way

💯 Exceptionally well-run company that consistently executes year after year

While it may take until next earnings for ULTA to fully recover from this guidance-driven gut punch, I'm very confident the long-term fundamental story remains intact. The selloff has created a gift in one of retail's highest-quality franchises.

The panel is lit up to buy ULTA aggressively under $450. Elite loyalty ecosystem, smart multi-channel strategy, and flawless execution - what's not to like?? I know analysts are sharpening their pencils, expect possible buy recommendations and a snap back.",0.66,22,0,22,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'DD'}]"

93,wallstreetbets,ALCC to acquire OKLO Inc -- Sam Altman (CEO of Open AI) taking 10+ year old Nuclear Fission company public,"Gather round and follow me down this regarded trail, I stumbled upon this looking at midstream pipeline companies originally inspired by the PAA trade (and other companies) mentioned in a few posts on this sub recently.  I saw a press release that Diamondback Energy (FANG) had signed a letter of interest (non-binding) in small nuclear reactors to power remote oil/gas rigs in.  Small nuclear reactors would replace large diesel generators.

 [U.S. shale producers to reduce Permian drilling emissions, increase reliability with nucle](https://www.worldoil.com/news/2024/4/1/u-s-shale-drillers-to-reduce-permian-drilling-emissions-increase-reliability-with-nuclear-reactors/)

I've been interested in the small nuclear reactor trade for a few months since I learned about Centrus Energy (LEU).  So I looked into OKLO -- which turns out is about to go public via spac with ticker $ALCC it will trade under ticker $OKLO once merger is complete.  Sam Altman CEO of Open AI is Chairman of the board at OKLO and ALCC is his SPAC.

Highlights of merger include a long lock up period and this merger is quoted as ""not being done to give early investors a chance to cash out.""  Transaction values Oklo at 850M (holds 516M in cash) and this transaction provides another 500M of capital for continued operations.  ALCC market cap today is 580M.

Sam also put up 375M of the 500M recently raised by Helion-- a nuclear FUSION company--for larger scale applications.  They are not direct competitors because OKLO is focused on small FISSION reactors 15-50MW and Helion is focused on FUSION.  For reference, 15MW is enough to power about 3000 Single Family Homes.

\--Oklo has been around since 2013.  They are going public to support the buildout of their facilities in Idaho and Ohio.    
\--Sam got involved in 2014 when he was president of Y combinator.  This is a bet on Sam, his knowledge, connections, and his belief that we will need nuclear power to support our AI ambitions.    
\--Technology used in the proposed Oklo reactor has been around since the 1960s.  This will help with regulatory approvals.   
\--Public and political opinions surrounding nuclear power are trending more favorable.  Meaning nuclear is still up for discussion regardless of who wins the election in November.  
\--We are continually consuming more and more power.  We will have to scale up our output somehow.  All signs are pointing to that additional power coming from nuclear.

94,wallstreetbets,Cannabis - not too late to get high bros,"EDIT:  I WAS RIGHT YOU REGARDS!!! LETS FUCKIN GO




Ok here’s the deal.  We all remember the hype when Canada legalized.  Everyone thought it was the ultimate infinite money glitch.

And for a while, based on the hype, it was.  Canada was the first major first world country to outright legalize (sorry Netherlands your half measures are no good for stonks), and the outlook was looking good for US legalization.  We had a boomer Republican president in the US at the time, but one who was decidedly less hostile to Marijuana than the typical boomer Republican.  Speaking of boomers…their parents who grew up watching reefer madness and blamed all crime on Mexican reefer addicts and always voted 98% no to any loosening of marijuana laws were finally starting to fucking die.  No one under 40 still thought it should be illegal and the national pulse had finally turned in favor of legalizing nationwide in the US.  Everyone saw it coming imminently.

But Canada is a nation of 38 million.  Barely a single major city in the US.  Not nearly enough to justify the size and scope of the weed market that emerged.  The stonks soared.  I remember ACB at 200 times it’s current price.

But it slowly dawned that no, in fact, America wasn’t going to reschedule, let alone legalize.  There wasn’t going to be a big enough market to support all the infrastructure the Canadian firms invested in.  The stocks cratered and a lot of degenerates lost a lot of money.

Then Biden, a democrat, gets elected….the democrats being the party who overwhelmingly support legalization, it stood to reason that a liberalization of American marijuana law was imminent and again the stocks popped, though nowhere near the 2019 highs.  This is where I jumped in (MJ ETF, ACB and OGI)…and again, it slowly dawned that US legalization was going nowhere…and again the stocks slowly waned, punctuated occasionally by big pops on irrelevant news like another state legalizing…each time I thought this was it, this time it turns around for good.

I lost like 75% before giving up and selling my shares, and good thing I did, because I’d have lost another 75% had I sat on it.

Now Germany just legalized and again the stocks are popping and a lot of us can’t see past these old painful memories.  I get it.

Just hear me out.

Now keep in mind right off the bat Germany is a much bigger nation and economy than Canada (&gt;2X the population and 2x the GDP, roughly).  It alone can support a much larger market than Canada.  So the pop in weed stocks we’ve seen now is already justified and yet they still have tremendous upside.

But my fellow regards, this is just the warmup round.

Joe Brandon is in trouble.  He’s behind in the polls, he’s seen as old, stuffy and senile.  His oldness, stuffiness and senility are perfectly encapsulated by his antiquated commitment to continuing marijuana prohibition.  It’s worth noting that he is the leader of a party that abandoned its commitment to marijuana prohibition decades ago and while he’s stubbornly been clinging to it more and more of the old fuddie duddie hardliners have died and almost no one in the country still supports continuing prohibition.  Certainly almost no democrats.  Also, RFK is running as an independent and he has confirmed he will make marijuana legalization a priority.  While RFK will be pulling support from trump too (think Covid hoaxery) I am convinced he’ll be pulling harder from Brandon.

Brandon needs something big to revitalize his campaign, and he’s been dropping hints that marijuana very well could be that thing.  April is “second chance month” and this year he went further than before in his commentary on the topic, suggesting rescheduling and/or hinting at legalization.  Kamala Harris has been pressuring the DEA to take action now.  Things are happening that are unlike anything from 2019 or 2021.  Traditionally 4/20 is associated with marijuana and the bettor in me senses something big may be coming this month, possibly on or around that day.

Yes, marijuana stocks are up somewhat on German legalization, but still down well over 90 to 95% or more from the 2019 highs.

I’m not saying YOLO on weed calls.  But picking up some shares right now is a relatively low risk (the stocks are already so so so far downbeaten with residual pessimism) move with tremendous potential upside.

TLDR; buy weed stonks before 4/20

Position (edited to reflect additions since OP): 5,000 Tilray in at 2.41.  2,000 SNDL at 2.40.  500 ACB at 6.90.  800 CURLF at 5.45.  500 CGC at 9.55.  No options (NB4 ‘if you really believes in your DD you’d YOLO your life savings into calls’, I’m 40 years old and have 4 kids, I can’t afford the risk.  I don’t fuck with options, ever).

I’ve read some DDs on here that convince me Tilray is the strongest play.  Pick whatever suits you.

This is not financial advice.  I’m a regard

********

Some more edits.

1) German legalization not being true commercial legalization.

True and a valid point.  The play here is not on German legalization.  The play is on an anticipation of a forthcoming change in US law.  Apart from being the worlds largest economy, the US has been the stick bearer enforcing marijuana prohibition around the world.  Many nations have wanted to legalize in the past but have been held back by the UN convention on psychtropic drugs from the 70s…the U.S. has been the standard bearer of enforcement of that convention.  Once the US legalizes, I think that this UN convention loses relevancy and the dominoes will start falling in short order and many more nations will legalize.  The smart money knows this and the bulk of the movement in the stock will all happen once the US announces meaningful change.  The play is to get ahead of that announcement.

2) edited GDP ratio of Germany to Canada because yes that data point was off

3) if y’all can’t handle some embellishment I can’t help you.  The NYC metro area is 23M people.  Canada has 38M.  I think it’s fair to say 38M, as the population of one of the world’s top economies, “barely” exceeds that of a single city’s metropolitan area.  Yes you regards, the specific data point  is embellished to emphasize the fact that the US has 10 times the population and 12 times the GDP of its northern neighbor.  It’s a much much bigger deal.  When you consider the likelihood of copycat legalizations in the wake of US moves, now is the time!",0.84,4571,0,4571,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'DD'}]"
95,wallstreetbets,"CHK-SWN merger to create largest US natural gas producer, Q2 2024 – how to play","I’ve been following Chesapeake Energy since January, when they announced a $7.4 billion acquisition of rival SWN – Southwestern Energy, but over the Easter weekend I finally had time to delve into the details. My original hunch has been confirmed so here’s my write up.

CHK restructured during Covid and over the past few years has been buying up its regional rivals – Vine Energy in 2021, Chief Oil &amp; Gas in 2022, and now SWN in 2024. Despite this it has over a billion dollars in cash and nearly 2 billion if you count short-term investments. As the macroeconomic environment stabilises we should now begin to see these investments being realised and, after thinking all week about how to play this, I have decided to ride SWN (the company which will be merging into CHK) upwards all the way to the merger and beyond, as this should maximise upside potential.

Key points:

* Merger on track for Q2 2024, this will make the new CHK-SWN combination the largest US natural gas producer, period.

* Expect SWN to continue its upwards trajectory as interest ramps up closer to the time and investors seek ways to play the US energy market this summer.

* $7.4 billion acquisition value provides a price floor significantly limiting any downside risk

* Natural gas becoming crucial to national security, demand is rising increasing existing profits and making new developments profitable

* SWN is sitting on 2.5 million undeveloped acres in Canada. Currently unable to be developed due to Canada’s ban on hydraulic fracturing, however should the winds change later this year SWN’s historic highs in the $40s (in 2014 before the fracking ban) give us an indication of how high it could rise. Note that this last point is a long shot but not essential – it would only be the cherry on top of the icing.

Risks:

* The FTC will be following this merger due to antitrust concerns. However, in my view the Biden administration will not risk alienating key states such as Pennsylvania (where most of SWN’s activities are) and Texas (its headquarters) in an election year. Also, CHK's past acquisitions have all gone through, and, with no news since Jan and the Q2 date coming up, everything is on track as expected.


Positions:

* Half in SWN Jan 2025 $10 strike leaps, the other half in shares. Play shorter expirations if you are feeling riskier. This is not financial advice.",0.92,70,0,70,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'DD'}]"
96,wallstreetbets,Solventum- Potentially undervalued spin-off,"The following Due Diligence is pretty simple and straightforward. 

Solventum operates in the medical/nursing care industry and provides many commodities and hardware to dental clinics, hospitals and medical institutions/research facilities. Think about scalpels, gloves, respiratory equipment, bandages, teeth fillings and crowns, x-ray and other dental equipment, and also some medical electronic hardware/software and filtration and purification systems.

Currently( April 3rd, 2024), in their **specific** industry, they have the highest ROA( 9.78%), 5th highest ROE( 11.5%) and the highest ROIC(11.43%). Their debt to equity ratio is 0.01 and cash to debt ratio of 1.98, both of which are very good. In fact, even though they are spin-off, they basically have no liabilities and actually have a negative net debt (excess cash) of 96 million dollars, according to their December 2023 reports. 

Joel Greenblatt, a legendary investor who made a significant amount of his fortune thanks to spin-offs and wrote a book about his experiences, emphasizes the potential upside such newly founded companies can present to investors. Usually, when a spin-off is completed, Mr Market creates a bearish attitude towards the stock and sends it down. It can occur several days or weeks after the spin-offs' IPO and it creates a lucrative buying opportunity. 

Right now, I'm waiting for such an opportunity to manifest.

 \-10%, -15%, -20% are normal occurrences with spin-offs short time after an IPO. 

I see here a potential repeat of GE HealthCare, GE's spin off from last year, where the stock plummeted in the range of -10% days after the IPO and both GEHC and SOLV operate in the medical sector( albeit slightly different focuses). Now its true that GE itself outperformed its Spin off by a large margin, but I suspect it was both the fact that the company was improving its fundamentals, Chris Hohn's involvement with the company and also perhaps because of a heavy bullish pressure from buyers to be eligible to own its future spin-off, Vernova. 

I think we can all agree here that 3M is a dumpster fire and will continue to lose value for its shareholders, at least for the next 12 months.

Full disclosure, I own some KLG stock, spin-off to K, and I bought it around November-December after it dropped 40% in October last year **and** after 6 insiders purchased 2 million worth of stock. 

I missed out on a buying opportunity with WS, a spin-off to WOR, after it dropped -19% several days after its IPO( there was no real reason, just sucking my thumb honestly). 

It is true that not all spin-offs are created equal. However, those that come from well-established, old and mature enterprises, from traditional industries and sectors, perhaps current( and former) industry leaders, offer rare upside for *RELATIVELY* low risk.

That's about it, folks.

97,wallstreetbets,TSMC Earthquake DD,"**Like most of you guys I was initially worried about the earthquake and. TSMC.**

**HOWEVER.... I remembered that Taiwan is on the ""Ring of Fire""**

**AKA where all the tectonic plates hit each other a ton creating volcanoes and ELEVATED EARTHQUAKE RISK.**

**\*\*QUESTIONS TO ASK\*\***

**1) Why would TSMC not consider ""Ring of Fire"" in their own contingency/safety plans?**

**2) Why would Nvidia and AMD lawyers not put in clauses requiring elevated safety standards and precautions to offset risk?**

**Article 1:** [**TSMC Case Study - Earthquakes**](https://esg.tsmc.com/en/update/governance/caseStudy/1/index.html)

**Article 2:** [**Shock Absorbers Help Taiwan Chip Plants Avoid Quake Damage**](https://www.asiafinancial.com/shock-absorbers-help-taiwan-chip-plants-avoid-quake-damage)

**Key Points from Article 1:**

* Following the September 21, 1999, Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, TSMC has laid down a series of earthquake protection management plans surpassing legal requirements. The company has conducted a comprehensive investigation on all buildings and facilities, set up dampers to improve building structures, and adopted new anti-seismic technologies and methodologies to assess and control the risks.
* TSMC's strategy is to simultaneously enhance the seismic resistance of facilities along with emergency response skills. On February 6, 2016, another earthquake struck southern Taiwan, in Mei-Nong District of Kaohsiung. It was the most powerful earthquake experienced by TSMC Fab 6 and Fab 14 in Tainan Science Park. With the above antiseismic methodologies, TSMC's Fabs were safe from structural damage, chemical leakage, process tools misalignment, fire and casualty.

|2000|

The seismic coefficient was improved beyond legal requirements by as much as 25% for main structure of new buildings, 50% for nonstructural components. New seismic anchorage was installed onto equipment and facilities.

|2008|

The greatest potential earthquake hazard analysis of each site, evaluation of anti-seismic ability of hardware facilities. Dampers were installed along with new Fab; seismic response was reduced by 15 - 20%.

|2012|

Floating piles were installed in new Fabs of Tainan Science Park, which decreased seismic amplitude by 25% in the Fabs. Evaluation of raised floor shaking table test and improvement of process tool anchorage.

|2013

Installation of seismic isolation platform onto furnace tool.

|2015|

Establishment of Earthquake Early Warning System. 

|2016|

Additional stoppers were installed for tower stocker to prevent sliding and ceiling bracings added to strengthen ceiling.

**The guiding principles of TSMC earthquake management policy are ""Zero casualty, short operation recovery time and least impact on customers"". Cross-Fabs post-earthquake emergency response procedures and business continuity plans were established according to these guiding principles. Constantly and systematically, TSMC minimizes damage caused by earthquakes and enhances anti-seismic ability.**

**Article 2:**

# Shock Absorbing Plant Designs

“In terms of foundries, due to shock-absorbing plant designs, earthquake vibrations inside fabs are one level of magnitude less than outside,” the semiconductor group said in a note on Monday, adding that it had received no reports of substantial factory damage.

“In the worst case, some machinery required initialization after crashing,” it said. “In terms of memory, [**Nanya Technology**](https://www.nanya.com/en/) has already carried out a shutdown inspection. If there was any wafer damage, Nanya maintains sufficient inventory to compensate.”

Meanwhile, [**Micron**](https://www.micron.com/) had recalled engineers to inspect its equipment “and has confirmed no losses. Thus, the capacity utilization rate of these two companies has not been affected nor has supply,” the TrendForce report said.

In regard to panel makers, it said the panel industry was currently on a down cycle because of serious sustained oversupply issues.

“Panel makers are reducing production in succession. Global average utilization rare in 3Q22 is expected to be revised to 65%,” it said. [**Innolux**](https://www.innolux.com/en/product-and-tech/tech/foplp.html), based in Tainan, had also started reducing producing on a large scale last September.

“Thus, the actual impact of the recent earthquakes should be limited in severity,” it concluded. “Machinery had been slowed or shut down for maintenance during the earthquake and operations have, subsequently, been resumed.”

Factory campuses had cancelled weekend overtime and returned to a normal shift schedule with only the sintering process in continuous operation. But the power supply in the Kaohsiung area was not affected by the quake and production line sintering furnaces remained in normal operation, the report said.

# Taiwan’s Importance

It is worth noting that Taiwan’s importance to the manufacturing of semiconductors, or computer chips, is similar to Saudi Arabia’s dominant position in OPEC and the global oil trade.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the self-ruled island’s biggest company, has a [**more than half of the global foundry market**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf), while other Taiwan-based manufacturers claim a further 10% of the market.

One of the reasons for US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the island last month was allegedly to [**convince TSMC to set up a manufacturing base in the United States**](https://theconversation.com/taiwan-dominates-the-worlds-supply-of-computer-chips-no-wonder-the-us-is-worried-188242).

It’s big money – the global semiconductor market was worth more than $520 billion in 2021. And with chips used in so many products these days, the sector’s importance has risen dramatically.

People in Taiwan are probably saying a quiet prayer of thanks that the weekend’s quakes were not a lot worse

98,wallstreetbets,$INTC as serious AI inference play,"I keep reading posts about Intel and consumer CPU's or GPU's. It is relatively insignificant if they sell some shitty GPU's for a new xbox. The real money is in datacenters and AI, specifically AI accelerators and inference chips for training / running models quickly. Nvidia has been the king with their monopoly-like features (optimisation, their ecosystem, CUDA, etc..), but Intel is making some serious moves. 

In the latest MLPerf benchmark from just a few days ago, which tests AI chips on tasks like object detection and large language models, Intel's Gaudi 2 is showing impressive results. Not to get too technical, but even David Salvator, Nvidia director of accelerated computing products, acknowledged that Intel's chip is actually competitive \[1\]. While Nvidia remains on top, price / performance wise Gaudi 2 beat them in Stable Diffusion and was close in the large language model. (Yes this is only inference - so does not reflect training, but this still shows potential). Intel said Gaudi 2 delivered a massive 1.42x jump in performance compared to their previous gen in just one year.

The generative AI market is estimated to hit $1.3 trillion by 2032, and we're in a unique position to guess who will be selling the shovels. As a bonus: Intel will be hugely susceptible to being hyped up during an AI bubble.

Besides all this, we know that the Biden admin just announced Intel is getting up to $8.5B in direct funding under the CHIPS Act, along with a 25% tax credit on over $100B in investments and eligibility for $11B in federal loans.

Intel could be a hedge against Nvidia, as they rely on TSMC. If geopolitical shit hits the fan, it could affect TSMC, which would impact Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and many others leaving intel as the only serious option.

**TLDR**: Intel's AI Chip is no Nvidia killer yet, but Intel's making solid progress. $INTC could be an interesting AI play. Pie is big enough.
