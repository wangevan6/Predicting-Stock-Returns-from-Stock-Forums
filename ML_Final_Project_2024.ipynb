It offers edge cloud platform, edge software development kit (SDK), content delivery and image optimization, video and streaming, cloud security, load balancing, and managed CDN.  &amp;#x200B;  # What differentiates Fastly from Akami?   **Why go with Fastly (investor)**  Because people do not understand the market, technology, and how the carrier business works. These are the same people that say \\u201c5G is coming\\u201d not realizing it is already here and has no effect on the carrier business.  **Why go with Fastly (customer)**  Sadly in technology sometimes people go with the cheapest provider then get their dick kicked in later, we call those CIO\\u2019s looking for jobs soon.  Akami - has a better suite of products / services. There backbone CDN is Zayo and old Level 3 dark fiber on 30-year contracts. Akami datacenter footprints are in the cheaper carrier hotels but you don\\u2019t need fancy. Akami has a better API.  Fastly - a smaller suite of product services. Their backbone is lit services from ATT and Century link on short term contracts. Their data center footprint is from a reseller in a reseller in a data center company. Mediocre API at best.  The core of the business is the backbone. Since Fastly does not control their ATT and Century link can groom them (lose redundancy or increase latency) without Fastly even knowing. Since the backbone is lit every time Fastly needs to increase the size of the connection they have to call ATT or CenturyLink and renegotiate a circuit and wait for them to turn it up. Akami just changes optics on a switch since they are lighting and managing their own dark fiber. They also will never get groomed.  **TLDR:** Basically Fastly is the choice for cash-poor companies or the guy that soon will be replaced. But it does have it\\u2019s placed, there is never a silver bullet in tech, but the mountain they have to climb from an investor perspective is monumental and long. I would work for them (if they had a solid RSU program), I would consider a long term share position (if I was younger) but not a short term explosion unless the unthinkable happens and someone scoops them up for 16 - 20 times EBITDA, but unlikely that high, because their customer base is already split between CDN providers and them, do not own a lot. All their network is easily matched by anyone, they are not sitting on the last strands of fiber on some awesome route or in a key data center that is at capacity.  &amp;#x200B;  Fastly CRUSHED earnings yesterday, they're doing really well in terms of growth. However, they disclosed that their largest client, which also accounts for 12% of sales, is TikTok. Shares are down 19% today on that news given TikTok could be banned in the US if not acquired by Sept 15.  &amp;#x200B;  IMO, I don't think Microsoft or any company would let TikTok get banned in the US. I'm playing on the fact that the acquisition will go through, and when it does, this stock will P.O.P.\",\n          \"HD Had missed EPS by -7.82% last quarter due to a number of reasons majority being huge over head from HomeDepot allowing employees paid time off and for those who worked double overtime that cost was $640 million to be exact... this qt they should have figured out the majority of cost issues and cut back on PTO and over time also revenue will undoubtedly be beaten.
